Tournament Director's Certification Program






USA Ultimate’s Tournament Director Certification Program (TDCP) was developed to educate event organizers about best practices for event management and provide tools to help organizers run high-quality events. The TDCP addresses USA Ultimate's strategic goal of providing the highest quality competitive events in the U.S.   

            The cornerstone of the TDCP is the Tournament Director’s Manual 2.0 (updated November 2017). In it, organizers will find important and useful information, based on industry best practices and the experience of top event organizers across the country.

About
The tournament experience highlights the second "C" in USA Ultimate’s Mission Statement: to advance the sport of ultimate in the United States by enhancing Character, Community, and Competition.  While tournaments are definitely not unique to our sport, they seem to be more prevalent in ultimate across skill levels and they are not just at the end of the season. Single games outside of tournament play can address both Character and Competition.  It is the exposure to a tournament, to numerous teams and scores of players, to the immersion in the sport and to one’s fellow athletes, both teammates and opponents, for a day or longer that demonstrates the ultimate community.  
Tournaments are a huge part of ultimate and tournament experiences, both positive and negative, have a large impact on participants’ experiences of our sport.  So it is very important that athletes, coaches, chaperones, family members and fans enjoy our tournaments.  There is a direct correlation between the quality of the tournament and how much participants and attendees enjoy it.
