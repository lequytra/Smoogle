One In Three Parents Would Take Their Kids Out Of Flagship Schools

Parents harbour grave misgivings over flagship schools, with one in three prepared to remove their child from school in protest.
Fears over a lack of accountability and improper use of selection, as well as suspicions that they are being used as a backdoor route to privatizing education, have prompted unease among many parents.
And hostility to the schools is actually greatest among parents whose children attend them, despite a belief that they lead to better teaching and drive up standards.
The introduction of academy schools in England in 2000 was one of the most far-reaching education reforms of the past quarter century. 
The state-funded schools, free of local democratic oversight, aim to give more autonomy to school leaders, and share some characteristics with the charter school movement in the U.S.


Schools can voluntarily "convert" to become an academy, or can be taken over by existing academies or groups of academies, over the objections of parents and school leaders.
As of last year, academies accounted for around 35% of all state-funded schools in England and educated around 47% of students, but have remained controversial, not least because they are seen as being favored by government, ahead of schools which have remained within the local system.

Academies are frequently singled out for ministerial praise and chosen to host ministerial visits, while schools that stay within the local system are routinely ignored.
But despite being seen as broadly successful in purely educational terms, a new survey reveals that they are far from being loved.
While almost half of parents said academies improved standards of education and resulted in better teaching and leadership, there was little enthusiasm when it came to having their own children taught in one.
Almost two in five (39%) parents whose children were not at an academy said they would be opposed to their childâs school becoming an academy, while fewer than one in five (18%) would support such a move.
And just over a third (34.1%) of parents said they would remove their child from school if it became an academy.
While most academy conversions have been carried out regardless of the views of parents, there are instances where parent-led campaigns have managed to stop or delay academization.
Surprisingly, hostility to academies was higher among parents of children who attended an academy. While two fifths (39%) of parents said they wanted the government to scrap the academy system, among parents of children at academies the figure was 43%, according to a survey of 750 parents carried out by Oxford Home Schooling.
Among the chief concerns over academies are that they are unaccountable (chosen by 46% of parents), that they donât have to follow the national curriculum (48%) and that they can result in expensive staff salaries (47%).
More than half of parents (53%) said academies can be selective in which students they admit, even though they must comply with a national admissions code which expressly prohibits selection by ability. 
Significant proportions of parents saw academies as damaging to other schools (39%), leading to a schoolâs loss of identity (41%) and motivated more by profits than by child development (45%). More than half (55%) of parents saw academies as a move towards privatization.
Dr Nick Smith, principal of Oxford Home Schooling, said that while there were a number of benefits to the academy system, there was clearly a large proportion of parents who oppose it for their children.
"With this in mind, schools and academy leaders would be wise to consult with parents to address their doubts about the system before forcing institutions to change their identity," he said.
