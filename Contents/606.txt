STEM Learning
Robo Wunderkind



According to the federal report, Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education, the U.S. Department of Education is furthering efforts to increase STEM-related learning across the education space. The report states that the federal government remains committed to partnering with stakeholders at all levels while also focusing on providing more opportunities for underrepresented student populations.
As a result, both schools and informal learning programs with a STEM focus are gaining traction throughout the country. Federal investment is supporting a wide variety of STEM education activities across all age groups and learning environments. The goal is to produce workers with the skills to participate in an ever-demanding, complex modern economy. Jobs in STEM industries are expected to grow to nearly 9 million by 2022, yet science education has lagged in participation for years. 
To better compete globally, STEM education in the United States is embracing innovative methods of learning at the very early stages of the education cycle. It has become apparent that improvements surrounding STEM initiatives should also include a rethinking of the way STEM is taught to K-12 students


To delve more specifically into the future of education, I spoke with Anna Iarotska, cofounder and CEO of Robo Wunderkind, an award-winning education technology company that provides innovative early education solutions currently in use in over 200 schools worldwide. It was informative to gain a better perspective of STEM education concentrating on the often underserved K-5 segment of the market.
Rod Berger: What are the areas of STEM education, robotics and coding you felt required attention and contributed to your increased involvement?
Anna Iarotska: Overall, we noticed that there were not enough STEM tools designed with the needs of younger children in mind and that propelled our decision to create Robo Wunderkind. It is crucial for children to learn how to be creative with technology, even at a younger age.

There is a particular âwindow of opportunityâ during the ages of five, six and seven when children start thinking in abstract terms and create a picture of the world in their heads. During this age range, children begin developing beliefs about their abilities and those beliefs will influence their future choice of profession and also their life. We wished to inspire children to engage with robotics and coding by introducing them early and in a playful way. 
Berger: To prepare to fill the jobs of the future, why is it important for education to focus on STEM, robotics and coding skills? Is enough attention currently given to these areas?
Iarotska: The U.S. will need to produce millions of new computing experts in the coming decades. Computing skills are currently one of the most wanted skillsets in the U.S. job market. Itâs becoming evident how essential these skills will be to the children of today for the job market of tomorrow. 
Things are improving as more and more countries are making coding and robotics a part of their curriculum and investing a lot of money into STEM education. The U.S., China, Russia, and Switzerland are examples of countries taking the initiative. 
In the future, coding skills will be necessary outside the field of software engineering. The areas of marketing and financial analytics come to mind as particular examples. An understanding of how programming works will become one of the requirements to perform oneâs daily tasks at many jobs. 
Berger: STEM is separated from traditional science and math education by its emphasis on blended learning environments. How do your efforts show that scientific methods can be applied to everyday life?
Iarotska: We definitely see a growing trend of an interdisciplinary approach to education, and this trend inspires us. Robo Wunderkind can be implemented in the teaching of other disciplines, not only coding in itself. It demonstrates that coding is not just the future of computing skills, but a piece of the whole interdisciplinary learning process.
We offer over 70 hours of lessons, and besides the core curriculum, there are also art lessons, where children learn about visual art, music, drama, and writing. Kids learn to express themselves creatively with the help of technology. Math lessons are also available. Math can be pretty challenging to many pupils, but we believe that with a playful mindset and the help of a fun robot named Robo, it can be an adventure. It can be much more comprehensive, even to those kids who would otherwise find it difficult. 
Berger: Do you feel there is a need to direct STEM curriculum toward attracting underrepresented populations, such as female students and minorities? What specifically are you doing to close the learning gap?
Iarotska: Of course! Weâre especially focused on including more girls in coding, which is why we always present our toy as a tool made for every child, regardless of gender, and why our robot is gender neutral. We want girls (and boys) to always feel welcome to code and program whatever their minds can imagine! 
Today in the U.S., only 18% of all people graduating with computing degrees are female. If the current trends persist, only one in five computing jobs will be held by a woman, which is a shameââthatâs nearly half the human creativity and ingenuity missing from the picture. The key solution is to engage girls in coding in primary school. Itâs important to maintain their interest throughout middle and high school, then encourage them to take up more computing classes at university. What better way to start than with a colorful small robot?  
We also regularly take part in different events that support girlsâ engagement in STEM. For instance, we recently took part in GirlsDay Mini, an event organized by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs, and designed to support girlsâ creativity in the tech field. Furthermore, our two free apps require no previous language knowledge, which makes it usable for children from any background.
Recently, there was a report about the economics of including more women in computing jobs, which only reinforced our efforts in closing the STEM gender gap. Womenâs rates of participation in computing jobs are decreasing, which can only be tackled through good STEM education. If this is addressedââand theoretically, if we triple the number of women in computing jobs in the nearest decadeââthey could increase their cumulative earnings by $299 billion over the next 10 years. The data is important because studies have shown that women are statistically more likely to be struck by poverty than men.
Berger: What relation will STEM have to our future economy and what role can students play in that growth trajectory? 
Iarotska: Computing jobs are unfilled and computing skills are in very high demand. Itâs a promising field with many options, and it evolves and develops every day. If you think of the jobs that exist today and how they were unimaginable only a decade agoââjust think of the things weâll be able to do 10 years from now.  
STEM education focuses on the real-world applications of problem-solving and we see Robo Wunderkind as a possibility for children to exercise their talents and discover their passion for STEM professions. A lot of technology around us is programmed and gives children an early understanding of how today's technology world works. It allows kids the possibility to discover for themselves with tools to implement their ideas.
On Instagram, we recently launched a competition among our users to submit their projects. We had devices ranging from a shoe cleaning robot to a cat feeding machine to a kitchen machine with sensors to automate specific tasks. It made so much sense to us. Children see devices in the world around them and they want to build them too. We are preparing an impact evaluation study of what kind of effect it has on children. But in the meantime, judging from the feedback we received, we know we are on the right path.
The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
