Women's
We shortened formats due to weather and we needed to lose a round of pool play.  We were going to cut the 6 v 7 pool game but, after looking at Saturday results, were much happier to play it in favor of the less evenly matched 1 v 7 game.
 
Rockford Beaches, Sand Cats, and LAMP all finished 4-1 against common opponents and 1-1 against each other.  Based on the reported scores and the tie-breaker rules, we next looked at the point differential between those three teams in the games against each other.

1) Rockford Beaches (Madison, WI) 4-1, 1-1, +1 
2) Sand Cats (Durham, NC) 5-1, 1-1, 0
