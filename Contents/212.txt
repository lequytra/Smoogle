11th Edition Rules Addenda
 
The following changes have been approved for use in the college, youth, masters and club championship series and regular seasons: 

End Zone Size - End zone length will be shortened to 20 yards.  This change allows for consistency with WFDF rules used in international competition and increases the number of field sites that can be used for ultimate.

Contact Call - If contact occurs between the thrower and marker that would constitute a foul under XVI.H.3.a but the thrower does not release the disc, "contact" may be called. Play does not stop and the marker resumes the stall count at "one". Other than resetting the stall count to "one" after the first instance, the "contact" call is treated as any other marking violation. The marker may contest the "contact" call by calling "violation", which stops play. If the thrower calls "contact" after beginning the throwing motion and subsequently releases the disc, it is treated as if the thrower called "foul".

 

 
2020-21 Rules
 
USA Ultimate recently completed revisions and updates to the Official Rules of Ultimate. The Rules Working Group and Spirit, Officiating and Rules (SOAR) Committee took into account extensive feedback from the community in devising the 2020-2021 Official Rules of Ultimate, which was approved by the USA Ultimate Board of Directors on August 27, 2019.
The 2020-2021 Official Rules of Ultimate will be officially in effect beginning January 1, 2020. All USA Ultimate competition in 2019, including the club postseason series and the 2019 National Championships, will use the 11th Edition rules. Outside of USA Ultimate competition, event organizers and tournament directors are free to incorporate any or all of the updated rules between now and the end of 2019.

Ultimate in 10 Simple Rules





by Steve Courlang and Neal Dambra

The Field: A rectangular shape with end zones at each end. A regulation field is 70 yards by 40 yards, with end zones 25 yards deep.
                 
Initiate Play: Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. The defense throws ("pulls") the disc to the offense. A regulation game has seven players per team.
                 
Scoring: Each time the offense completes a pass in the defense's end zone, the offense scores a point. Play is initiated after each score.
                 
Movement of the Disc: The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. Players may not run with the disc. The person with the disc ("thrower") has ten seconds to throw the disc. The defender guarding the thrower ("marker") counts out the stall count.
                 
Change of Possession: When a pass is not completed (e.g. out of bounds, drop, block, interception, stalled), the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.
                 
Substitutions: Players not in the game may replace players in the game after a score and during an injury timeout.
                 
Non-contact: No physical contact is allowed between players. Picks and screens are also prohibited. A foul occurs when contact is made.
                 
Fouls: When a player initiates contact on another player a foul occurs. When a foul disrupts possession, the play resumes as if the possession was retained. If the player committing the foul disagrees with the foul call, the play is redone.
                 
Self-Officiating: Players are responsible for their own foul and line calls. Players resolve their own disputes.
                 
Spirit of the Game: Ultimate stresses sportsmanship and fair play. Competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.

Experimental Events

In order to help further develop and refine the sport, USA Ultimate is committed to experimenting with rules and rules implementation at its own events and in partnership with other event organizers. Tournaments where these experiments take place allow players, organizers and USA Ultimate a way to assess a variety of innovations and ideas in a setting that provides both support for implementation of changes and a process for feedback on and analysis of their impacts. The goal of this initiative is the improvement of the sport in a structured manner that encourages educated discussion and decision making that is in line with the organization's mission.
