The college admission scandal has gone international in a case involving the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

Another parent has been arrested in connection with the âVarsity Bluesâ college admissions scandal. This is the 35th arrest or indictment of a parent. 52 people in all have been charged. A complete list of the persons charged and the status of their cases can be found here. The arrest takes place shortly after the actor Felicity Huffman became the first person sentenced in connection with the wide-ranging investigation.
The new arrest is especially interesting because of its international scope. The defendant, 48-year-old Xiaoning Sui, is a Chinese citizen who legally resides in British Columbia, Canada, and was arrested while in Spain. The United States Justice Department is now seeking to extradite her to the United States for trial.
Ms. Sui is charged with handing over a tremendously large amount of money to Rick Singer, the alleged mastermind of the criminal admissions scheme: $400,000. (By contrast, Ms. Huffman gave Singer $15,000). Ms. Suiâs goal was to have her son admitted to UCLA as a soccer player.


According to the Justice Department, âOn Oct. 24, 2018, Singer instructed Sui to wire Singer $100,000 which would be âpaid to the coach at UCLAâ in exchange for a letter of intent from the UCLA soccer coach . . . In February 2018, Sui allegedly wired an additional $300,000 to the KWF [Singerâs fraudulent charity] account as final payment for her sonâs fraudulent admission to UCLA.â
As part of the alleged fraudulent scheme, former USC soccer coach, Laura Janke, who has already plead guilty, created a fake profile for Suiâs son, portraying him as a star soccer player. In fact, the son does not play soccer, at least not seriously. Her son was not only admitted to UCLA, but he received a significant scholarship to attend.

The international nature of the case may create some obstacles for the prosecutors. First of all, Sui remains in Spain, which will have to agree to extradite her to the United States. Also, there is the question of language. Apparently, Sui used a translator to communicate with Singer. This leaves open the defense that Sui did not really understand what she was doing, especially since, as a Chinese citizen living in Canada she might not fully understand the college admissions system in the United States.
