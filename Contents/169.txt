Web Accessibility Statement












Grinnell College is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.
This website endeavors to comply with best practices and standards as defined by Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act and level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user-friendly for all people.
If you would like additional assistance or have accessibility concerns, please contact the Office of Communications, 641-269-3400.
All site pages are being run through a W3C compliant validation product, currently SiteImproveâ¢, to monitor compliancy to WCAG guidelines.Â 
We will continue to test the site to make sure that all content on the site is accessible to all visitors.
We will also continue to work to improve the accessibility standards of our website.

Images
Unless they are purely decorative items, all images used on this web site have suitable alt attributes.
Content should be usable/accessible with images "off" (disabled).
Links
Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already fully describes the target.
Links are written to make sense out of context.
URLs are permanent whenever possible.
Forms
All form controls are appropriately and explicitly labeled.
Scripts
The static pages of this web site are usable without JavaScript.
Pop up Windows
In visual browsers, the title attribute of links to external resources says "opens in new window".
Browsers with Popup Blockers should be able to access these external documents.
Visual design
This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout.
If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the content of each page is still readable.
Any information conveyed through the use of color is also available without color (i.e. text based).

Known Accessibility Issues
We are currently working to fix the following issues (as of May 2017):
New text content is now added to the site using appropriate structural markup. We are reviewing older content (prior to October 2013) and continuously working to make it compliant.
New videos are added with captions and/or transcripts. We are currently working to provide captions and transcripts for older audio and video materials.
Images added to the site prior to October 2013 may lack alternative text detail.
