The definitive guide to the academic and professional profiles of the Stanford GSB MBA Class of 2020
Getty



The economics major from Harvard who leveraged her Goldman Sachs internship into a fast-track career at Bain & Co. as a senior associate â check. The product manager at Google with his computer science degree from Stanford â check. Both are among the fortunate 419 MBA candidates who make up the Stanford GSB Class of 2020, where Harvard and Stanford dominate as the two biggest feeder schools for the worldâs most selective MBA program. 
But before you conclude that an Ivy league degree and prestige company are your golden ticket to Stanford GSB, youâll want to take a closer look. We did. In a meticulous feat of rabbit-hole diving through LinkedIn and input from successfully admitted clients, my colleagues and I compiled the educational and professional backgrounds of 353 of the 419 admits who started their MBA last year. That gives us a more than 84% sample size, and a lot of fascinating observations about what Stanford GSB is looking for.  
Ivy league feeder schools continue to dominate, but thatâs only part of the story.
Close to 14% of last yearâs incoming students did their undergrad at Harvard or Stanford (closely split with Harvard at 25 and Stanford at 23), along with 19 from Yale, 15 from UPenn and 13 from Columbia. Factor in Brown, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell and a hefty 130 of the 353 candidates we identified hailed from the Ivy league or Stanford. For an MBA that receives over 18 applications for every 1 place in the program, these nine schools account for more than 1 in 3 (36.8%) admits.


Surprises among the top feeder schools.
What may surprise you was that MIT barely made the top 25 feeder schools. We could find only three students (the same number as Georgia Tech), well behind Duke (seven), UNC (six), NYU (six) and Amherst (five). Brownâs 11 undergrads among the GSB class of 2020 beats Princetonâs contribution at just nine. It also intrigued us to see such notable representation from Notre Dame, which supplied half a dozen grads to outnumber Cornellâs five. On the west coast, UC Berkeley grads counted for six places, while USC outshines rival UCLA (five to four). 
Students from more than a dozen state schools made the GSBâs cut.
Not everyone attended an elite private college, but the numbers remain modest. Once we had accounted for UC Berkeley, UNC, UCLA, UT Austin, Georgia Tech, University of Virginia and U Michigan we could find only a dozen students who attended state schools, from Colorado and Cleveland State to several other UC schools (Davis, Irvine and San Diego), as well as big public research institutions like University of Washington and University of Minnesota. You can even graduate from the respectively obscure Belmont University in Tennessee (its US News rank is 166) if you go on to become a serial entrepreneur pioneering new territory in data science. 

Not just where you studied but what you studied
The Stanford MBA Class of 2020 has an average undergraduate GPA of 3.72, the highest among the M7 business schools. So clearly Kirsten Moss, Assistant Dean of MBA Admissions and her team in Palo Alto are looking for intellectual vitality, but as she discussed at the CentreCourt MBA Festival that we shared last year, âwhat have you done with your smarts?â The GSB loves applicants who are curious â whether geopolitically, socio-economically, at the intersection of finance and technology or the convergence of business and public policy. Beyond where you studied, Stanford is interested in what you studied and how that demonstrates your ability to develop new ideas and perspectives. 
One of the best illustrations of this among the feeder colleges for the Class of 2020 are the six admits from Georgetown University. From International Public Health and Government to International Affairs and Africa Regional Studies at the schoolâs prestigious Walsh School of Foreign Service, these Georgetown graduates were able to demonstrate their willingness to learn new things and share what they learned. Whether you have an informed perspective on a U.S.-China trade war, or the impact of technology on global health issues, any successful Stanford MBA applicant has thoughtfully shown why such awareness matter to them in the schoolâs iconic admissions essay. 
You can find the complete list of what the GSB Class of 2020 studied, and the 142 feeder schools we identified in the Fortuna Admissions Stanford MBA Deep Dive Analysis.
Track record of Stanford undergrads reflect GSBâs motto.
Change lives, change organizations, and change the world. Stanford GSB admissions believe that past actions are the best predictor of future actions, and want to hear about how you have created positive change in the organizations in which you have been involved. While some 20% of the Stanford MBA Class of 2020 who attended Harvard for undergrad went on to McKinsey, BCG or Bain & Co. (the top three consulting firms referred to as MBB), not a single one of the 23 admits from Stanford undergrad that we found listed an MBB company â or top five financial firm â as their most recent employer before starting business school. GSB admits hailing from Stanford undergrad are a more eclectic and altruistic bunch, including a program strategist at the Obama Foundation and a developer working to build tech and transportation infrastructure in a 14-country region from Morocco to Pakistan. 
Imperial College London and Indiaâs IIT overshadow Cambridge & Oxford.
It raised eyebrows to see that GSB enrolled more candidates from Imperial College London (four), Indian Institutes of Technology (four) and even Pontifica Universidad Catolica de Chile (three) than the universities of Cambridge or Oxford (two each). Brazilâs FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas (FGV) supplied two members to the GSB Class of 2020, overshadowing the countryâs top two universities Universidade Estadual de Campinas (one) and Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (one). Among the 353 profiles we analyzed, only 67 (19%) completed their undergraduate studies outside the US. Weâd love to hear from the international students we missed, whether from China, Chad or Chile! 
McKinsey leads feeder consulting firms, Goldman ahead in finance.
Itâs true that students with a full-time position at McKinsey at some stage in their pre-MBA resume (29) outrank their peers at BCG (23) and Bain (22). The big surprise was Deloitte, one of the âBig Fourâ which featured for 12 students to last yearâs class, not including two more from Monitor Deloitte. Goldman dominates the financial feeder companies with 13 former full-time employees in the GSBâs 2020 class, followed by Morgan Stanley (10), PwC (seven) and JP Morgan (five). Ernest & Young and KPMG each supplied one candidate. 


Microsoft supplies the same number as the Gates Foundation. 
Google noses ahead of its peers in tech with five students, while Facebook and Amazon each supply four to last yearâs incoming class at the GSB. Three candidates list YouTube among their employers, while only one of the 84% sample we researched hails from Apple. Itâs interesting to note that Microsoft supplied the same number of students â two â as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In fact, seven enrolled candidates worked in philanthropy, and they are a fascinating mix of unusual distinctions.  
Why great stories are the key to Stanford GSB admissions success.
Take the Fulbright Scholar and orchestra cellist who graduated from Stanford, founded a creative, kid-centric nonprofit and then worked in the software industry. Or the double major in psychology and law from Tel Aviv University who specialized in cyber security after four years with Israel Defense Forces. Then thereâs the chemical engineer from the University of Manchester with an MPhil from Cambridge who went on to KPMG Nigeria and then two years at McKinsey, and all the while he was running a laundry service he founded.  
At the end of the day, itâs about the power of story. If youâre going to change lives and change the world youâll need to capture the GSB admission committeeâs attention with a narrative that is distinctive, compelling and authentic. No doubt there were plenty of strategy consultants and investment bankers with Ivy league degrees who induced a yawn (and a pass) because they had little else to offer beyond gleaming academic and career credentials. 
Sure, your track record of excellence is requisite, but what Stanford GSB really wants to know is what matters most to you and why. Thatâs why the physics major from the University of Birmingham who built his career at Rolls Royce also secured one of 419 coveted seats out of 7,797 applications to the GSB last year. Itâs your unique story, when conveyed in a way thatâs coherent, powerful and credible, that can make all the difference. 
You can read more of the stories behind the statistics, along with access to deeper analysis of the industries, employers and job titles in the Fortuna Admissions Stanford MBA Deep Dive Analysis. 
Finally while we did sleuth out 353 of the 419 students in the Stanford MBA Class of 2020, we may have missed yours! Please let me know and weâll update and enhance our data pool.
