Sustainability

GreenGolf

Where Does the Golf Industry Stand on the Environment?
No matter what industry you are in, if you are responsible for the care of the grounds, there is a expectation that you are good steward of the property. Â TheÂ Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA) is helping lead the way in environmental stewardship. Â Â It is impressive that an industry driven by herbicides, pesticides, and maintenance equipment is actively researching and promoting more environmentally sound practices.
So what can/are we doing here at GCGC? Â I’m glad you asked. Â We’re researching different areas concerning our flora, chemical usage, equipment, and water controls.

Flora

Utilization of Ornamental grasses for aesthetics, erosion control, and wayfinding
Implementing native grasses in areas that notÂ considered in play while golfing
Researching shaded area coverage (pine straw, shaded grasses)


Chemical Usage

Reduction in herbicides being applied
Reduction in pesticides being applied
Alternative fertilizer usage
Reduce fuel consumption


Equipment

Utilization of reusable materials such as our sod faced bunkers

Less Erosion = Less Labor & Fuel Costs


HighÂ efficiency equipment and insulation practices within the buildings


Water Controls

Ensuring our irrigation system is operating effectively and efficiently
Utilizing aerators in lieu of chemicals to control moss buildup
Ensuring our creeks and tile lines are effective managers of our water runoff



More to come as these move from ideasÂ to strategy to implementation.Â We hope to make these positive changes, whileÂ keeping playability and aesthetics at the forefront of this project.
