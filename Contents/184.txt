  Ok start!


Needs a score reporter component and it's a little sparse, but the rulebook is nice and it's an ok start.

  Edit whiteboards


It I make a mistake I can't delete a path and the undo doesn't always work. There should be a select and then delete but dragging to the delete box that comes up doesn't seem to work. Clicking a line and tapping delete doesn't seem to do it either. Overall great app love being able to edit scores on the go and update fans/parents in real time with notifications.

  Small formatting issue


Needs to be updated for the aspect ratio of iPhone X and newer iPhones.
