      Academics

















        
                  We prefer defining our own path for discovery.
      
  
    



This is your education. Imagine what happens when you have the freedom to explore combinations of academic interests, issues within society, and other parts of the world? When it happens alongside the support and resources youâll find at Grinnell, we think you uncover an intellectual journey thatâs never done before.








      The Academic Experience











        
                  A liberal arts foundation.
      
  
    

Youâll gather information. Youâll collaborate with thinkers of every kind. Youâll deconstruct materials and reconstruct methods. Youâll also sharpen your skills for communicating what youâre working on, how it relates to others, and why it matters for the greater world.













        
                  An individually advised curriculum.
      
  
    

Your interests will grow, combine, and veer in uncharted directions. Thatâs good, because we believe thatâs where new opportunities take hold. Working with your adviser, youâll have the freedom and guidance to put together a curriculum tailored just for you.













        
                  Creativity and innovation.
      
  
    

To bring new ideas to the table and then out into the world, you have to question whatâs been done before. Here, we encourage you to venture into unknown territory in new fields and different philosophies.



















Majors & Concentrations

        
                  Some set a plan in stone. Others set a few ideas in motion.
      
  
    

Working alongside your advisers, youâll choose from over 500 courses across our many divisions and departments. You donât have to declare a major until the second half of your sophomore year. So youâve got time to explore your options, or you can focus your interests from the get-go.

Global

        
                  Studying abroad for a semester is just the start.
      
  
    

At Grinnell, global understanding goes beyond a single experience. Every place, every point in time, and every culture, brings with a unique point of view and version of the human experience. On campus, Grinnellians study these experiences and use them as lenses for approaching our disciplines, communities, and our impact on others. Youâll have access to global programs for language development, intercultural exchange, and community engagement, for here or wherever your studies take you.
