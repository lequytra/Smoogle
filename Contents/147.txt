Sharing our Vision
Well-designed learning environments promote inquiry, collaboration, and creativity. Inquiry-based learning is active, dialectical, and productive. It requires students to think deeply and critically, and it provides skills they need to thrive in their personal, civic, and professional lives.
Considerable investments in facilities have modernized many buildings on campus to support new methods of teaching and learning. However, buildings associated with the social studies and non-fine arts humanities programs have lagged behind improvements on the rest of campus. In their current states, the physical environments of ARH and Carnegie Hall often do not support Grinnellâs collaborative, creative, and inquiry- focused pedagogy. The Collegeâs new and renovated academic spaces will support the best student learning and most ambitious teaching that Grinnell Collegeâs faculty can execute today and imagine for the future.
The Admission/Financial Aid Center project and landscaping plan/campus entry project are connected both to the branding work thatâs been done and to our campus- community efforts to improve our sense of place.

Phase I Projects
Phase I includes three separate projects:

a new teaching and learning center known as the Humanities and Social Studies Center, of which ARH/Carnegie renovation and revitalization is a partÂ Â 
a new Admission/Financial Aid Center, including financial aid offices
the Comprehensive Campus Landscaping, Entry, and Wayfinding project

Funding
In April 2016, the Grinnell College Board of Trustees authorized a Phase I project budget at a total not to exceed $140 million. This includes building design, construction, and renovation as well as the purchase of needed academic technology and furnishings.
The fundraising goal is $20 million. The balance of Phase I financial obligations will be covered by a combination of debt and possibly support from the endowment. A proposal regarding the specifics of the financing plan will be presented to the Board of Trustees in late 2016 or early 2017.
