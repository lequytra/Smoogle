Johns Hopkins University
Cordish Lacrosse Center
Baltimore, MD

Housing the Johns Hopkins Universityâs powerhouse menâs and womenâs lacrosse programs, this 14,750 sf stand-alone Lacrosse Building is located on a prominent location at the east end of storied Homewood Field.  The facility enables a dramatic entry onto the field by the Hopkins lacrosse tams and provide a spectacular viewing platform and game-day facilities for coaches and guests.  An important recruiting tool, the Cordish Lacrosse Center integrates the rich history of the program with its architecture. Included in the program are lockers, training facilities, team meeting rooms, a reception space and coachesâ offices, as well as a gallery space celebrating the historic achievements of Hopkinsâ Lacrosse.
