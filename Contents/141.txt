Dual Degree Program





Washington University in St. Louis cooperates with a select group of affiliated colleges and universities to offer students the opportunity to earn a liberal arts degree from their current school and an undergraduate engineering degree from WashU. 

The Dual Degree Program is an attractive alternative to traditional engineering curricula. Program graduates are "liberally educated engineers," with strong communication and problem-solving skills, a broad background in the humanities and social sciences, and a high-quality technical education. Participants in our undergraduate two-year option commonly follow either a 3-2 or a 4-2 schedule, entering WashU after their junior or senior year. With one additional year of study at WashU (so three total years at WashU), students can earn an engineering master's degree in addition to their undergraduate engineering degree and their liberal arts degree from their current school.Advantages to our Dual Degree program include:opportunity to complete multiple degrees in diverse areasextra time to pursue other academic, athletic, or extracurricular interestsopportunity to use the supportive, personalized environment of a small liberal arts institution to develop the skills and confidence needed for success in engineeringacquire scientific problem-solving skills necessary to be effective in today's technological oriented societyTo prepare for career opportunities which require multidisciplinary teams to address challenges, students will develop strong oral and written communications, problem-solving and teamwork skills.Programs of study lead to the same degrees available to other students in the McKelvey School of Engineering.
