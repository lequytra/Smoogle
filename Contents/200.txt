The Youth Division began in 1988 and has grown to include more than 15,000 student-athletes across over 400 club and school-based teams. 2005 marked the introduction of a summer youth club competition structure to complement the existing high-school-based play season. The division currently includes championship play at the high school, U-20 and U-17 levels, in addition to a growing U-15 level and development-level programs for elementary and middle school players.

Youth Club Championships

 

The 2019 Youth Club Championships took place at the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minn. for the 15th consecutive year, Aug. 3-5, and was hosted once again by Minnesota Ultimate.
We have had a very positive response to combining YCC with the U.S. Open, so we will be continuing to hold them together.  



            2019 Youth Club Championships Winners:

Atlanta ATLiens and Boston BUDA (U-20 Boys)
Maine Rip Tide and Triangle Warhawks (U-20 Girls)
Indianapolis INcognito and Seattle Bankroll (U-20 Mixed)
Oregon Eruption! and Seattle Horizon (U-17 Boys)
Atlanta rATLers and Seattle Blossom (U-17 Girls)

 
Note: For perhaps the first time in USA Ultimate history, the final round at a major championship event was unable to be completed due to time constraints and lightning delays. It was not an easy decision to make, but athlete safety always comes first. As a result, the Youth Club Championships had co-finalists for the first time ever. Congratulations to all the finalists from this year's event!
