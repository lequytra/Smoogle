UGSDW negotiates 2.7 percent pay raise 
Sep 15, 2017 by News in Article

After an extended labor dispute, the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers (UGSDW) has signed on to a new contract that raises the hourly wage for dining services employees to $9.50 per hour. The negotiations have gone on for several months.Â  Â 
âThe College initially thought that no raise was at all necessary, given that they had given us a substantial increase in the previous year, said Cory McCartan ’19, president of the Union. “Our members didnât buy that, and so three times we rejected their final offer, and finally after a little more public information campaign and a one-day slow down, we think that finally the message was clear enough to the College that they were willing to move significantly towards our end goal.âÂ 
The Union unanimously voted to accept the collegeâs revised offer of $9.50 per hour, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous wage of $9.25.Â  Â 
âThatâs substantially more than an inflation increase for last year,â McCartan said. âItâs not quite to tuition, but itâs more than inflation, and fundamentally itâs a paradigm shift in â¦ the Collegeâs approach to student labor.âÂ 
The settlement on a $9.50 wage also satisfied the College.Â 
âThe College was very pleased the student dining union members accepted our latest wage proposal at $9.50, and look at this as a win-win agreement so that our students, faculty and staff will continue to receive a high-quality dining experience,â wrote Associate Vice Preisdent of Human Resources Mary Greiner in an email to The S&B.Â 
People on both sides of the negotiation table stressed the mutually beneficial nature of not only the most recent negotiations, but the existence of the Union.Â  Â 
 âWe should always be striving for a win-win whenever [possible],â McCartan said. âWeâve tried to work with the College from the beginning. I think we have a really positive relationship with administrators there and hope we can continue that.âÂ 
Greiner expressed similar sentiments. 
âWe look at the ratified contract as a win-win agreement and look forward to working with the students to continue to provide a great product,â she wrote.Â 
Student workers are, of course, not the only employees of Dining Services. The Dining Hall also employs non-student supervisors, as well as high school students. High school students were the subject of a minor disagreement with the administration following the last round of contract negotiations.Â 
âWhen we say UGSDW, thatâs both college students and high school students,â McCartan said. âWe fought hard last year to make sure the College followed up on its legal obligation to pay those high schoolers a fair wage and include them in the contract, as was intended all along. They finally did that, and weâre glad that happened.âÂ 
The wage increase is the most significant part of the new contract, and the Union claims that increasing pay can help combat low staffing levels in the dining hall.Â  Â 
âIn the six-week period following the ratification of the first contract, we saw unfilled shifts drop by 25 percent,â McCartan said.Â  Â 
 âThe College does keep statistics on filled and unfilled shifts,â Greiner said. âWe agree there has been some progress in reducing open shifts, however, increased compensation alone doesnât appear to be the only solution.âÂ 
Disagreement, then, still exists on the margins. However, following the conclusion of this most recent round of negotiations, it seems that both administrators and Union members are looking to the future.Â  Â 
 âWe do believe extending the contract from a one-year to a two-year agreement is a good outcome for both parties as discussions consume a considerable amount of time away from the students’ core purpose of being here to focus on their class work,â Greiner said. âThe extended timeframe of the contract will also allow additional time for both sides to evaluate and see trends that will help contribute positively to future discussions.âÂ  Â 
Leadership at the Union is also due for a shuffling as some of the founding members step aside to bolster fresh talent.Â 
âMy plan has from the beginning been to make this my last semester serving in a leadership capacity in the union,â McCartan said. âWe have some people who are second-years now who might want to run for leadership.â 
The newest contract is only one step along what McCartan hopes will be a long path for the first undergraduate student workersâ union in the country.Â
