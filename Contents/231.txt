Where it All Began
A captivating game was sweeping the continent at the end of the 19th century, a game which had been experienced by Grinnell College faculty members while on leaves of absence. Â This game, which the wags called “Pasture Pool” or by its more appropriate name, Golf, interested them so much that it lead to the formation of Grinnell Golf Club on Oct. 2, 1899.
There were 21 charter members who recognized the opportunity for an inexpensive healthful form of exercise and recreation. Â Some of the founders included: Prof. W.S. Hendrixson, C.W.H Beyer, Prof. J. Macy, Carrie Denise, E.W. Clark Jr, H.H. Robbins, and Frank Thayer
Honoring Tradition, Preserving the Future
The founders’ goals of creating recreation and social opportunities for Grinnellians have not been forgotten. Â Ownership has changed and with it the name, but the traditions still live on Grinnell College Golf Course.
