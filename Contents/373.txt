University at Albany, SUNY
Campus Center Expansion
Albany, NY

The Campus Center Expansion re-establishes the prominence of University at Albanyâs historic 1960s Campus Center by architect Edward Durrell Stone. The East Addition enhances food service operations with a new double height dining room with views to the north, east, and south. The West Addition includes a 400-seat Auditorium, a Multi-Use Rehearsal space, student offices and resource centers. A significant renovation of the existing food service and dining hall also provides a new entrance stair. The project is tracking LEED Gold and Silver certifications. The Associate Architect is Bergmann Associates. 

East Addition: 22,000 GSF
West Addition: 57,000 GSF
