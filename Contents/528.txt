To the best of our knowledge, all content is accurate as of the date posted, though offers contained herein may no longer be available. How many rewards credit cards do you have in your wallet? Do you know if youâre maximizing their rewards potential? Or are you just swiping them randomly, hoping it all adds up in the end?
According to a recent study by J.D. Power, only about one-third of credit card holders completely understand all of their cardâs benefits. Thatâs not so surprising. Between different point values for different types of spending, special bonus categories that may change every month or be capped, and redemption values that may also fluctuate, itâs tough to know how to maximize a cardâs benefits. But failing to do so means leaving benefits â and sometimes cold cash â on the table.

            Earn 50,000 AAdvantageÂ® bonus miles after making $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months        

 
Choosing an airline rewards card is not easy. There are multiple things to consider, including how often you travel, where youâre traveling, how likely you are to use lounge access and how much the miles are actually worth.
Most major U.S. airlines have rewards cards that work in tiers. There is usually a starter card with no annual fee but low rewards. Then there is a mid-tier card with rewards and added benefits, like discounts to lounges. Finally, the highest-tier card comes with a hefty annual fee, high spend requirements to receive bonuses and really are only worth it for frequent travelers.
To choose the best airlines rewards card, Forbes looked at airline rewards cards and compared them based on mile earnings, mile values, annual fees, discounts and additional benefits, including TSA Preâ or Global Entry credits. A great airline rewards card will also have no foreign transaction fee â whatâs the point of taking a card with you on your travels if it will cost you big bucks to swipe it during your adventure?
The Citi/AAdvantage Executive MastercardÂ checked off every benefit on our list and then some â it pays Preâ or Global Entry in full. Instead of giving discounted access to its lounge as some other cards do, it gives complete access to the cardholder andÂ authorized users. This is an impressive card, and travelers who want to be rewarded for both domestic and international travel should consider being loyal to American Airlines with this card.
Rewards: Earn two miles for every $1 spent on American Airlines purchases; earn one mile for every $1 spent on everything else.
Annual Fee: $450
Bonus Offer: Earn 50,000 bonus miles after spending $5,000 in purchases within the first three months of opening the account
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: This card comes with:

Admirals Club membership ($650 value and includes access for authorized users)
Global Entry or TSA Preâ application fee credit
First bag checked free on domestic including for up to eight travel companions
Priority boarding
VIP check in including eight companions
25% discount on inflight food and beverage purchases.

One drawback: This card doesnât offer companion certificates, as some other airline rewards cards do.

If thereâs a rewards card known for its travel perks, its undeniably the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. This card gives account holders the freedom to choose how they want to redeem their rewards â either through airlines or hotels â and consistently offers great sign-up bonuses (this card is also a Forbesâ pick for cards with the best sign up bonuses).
According to Chase.
Rewards: 2X points on travel, including airfare, hotels, taxis and trains; 2X points on dining worldwide; one point per $1 spent on everything else.
Annual Fee: $95
Bonus Offer: Earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases within three months of opening the account. According to Chaseâs website, this sign-up bonus is worth $750 toward airfare and hotels or $600 cash.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The Chase Sapphire Preferred card also comes with additional benefits, including:

$0 foreign transaction fees
Auto rental collision damage waiver
Trip cancellation/interruption insurance
Zero liability protection
Baggage delay insurance
1:1 point transfer value

One drawback of the card is that the $95 annual fee isnât waived for the first year, a perk offered by similar competitor cards.




HSBC Premier World Elite MastercardÂ®

Card With the Best Sign-Up Bonus 

HSBC Premier World Elite MastercardÂ®
Only available to those with a U.S. HSBC Premier checking account, the rewards and benefits seem insufficient to offset the high APR, lack of intro 0% APR offer, and high annual fee. Perhaps the status value of the metal card makes it worthwhile to some.

Thereâs no limit to how much cash back students can earn with this card.
Rewards: Earn 5% cashback each quarter in selected categories that include gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, Amazon.com and more, up to a quarterly maximum of $1,500; 1% cash back on everything else.
Annual Fee: None
Bonus Offer: None
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The 5% cash back categories change each quarter, so cardholders need to keep an eye on current offerings to maximize cash back earnings. Students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher receive a $20 statement credit each school year for up to five years.

Finding a great rewards card with no annual fee can be challenging, but the Discover it Cash Back cardÂ delivers on both aspects. The cash back percentage (up to 5%) is higher than what most cards offer, and the bonus of having all cash back matched at the end of the year is impressive. This is a great card for everyday purchases, but be aware that the 5% rewards categories change each quarter are are limited to $1,500 in spending per quarter. All other cash back rewards pay 1%.
Rewards: 5% cash back in specified categories each quarter, including gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, Amazon.com and more up to quarterly maximum of $1,500 in purchases; 1% cash back on everything else.
Annual Fee: None
Bonus Offer: All cash back earned is matched at the end of the year with no limit
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: It can get tricky to keep up with a changing rewards category each month, but theyâre typically geared toward everyday purchases like gas, restaurants and grocery stores. Itâs also a bonus that cash back never expires and can be redeemed in any amount at any time.

5 Things to Consider When Choosing a Rewards Credit Card
Rewards credit cards give you an incentive to spend on a specific card, but theyâre not all created equal. Many cards have different point values, meaning some points might be worth more than others. And adding to the confusion, some point values fluctuate based on how theyâre redeemed.
Before choosing a rewards credit card, consider the following:

How much do you need to spend in order to cover the annual fee? If you choose a card with a large annual fee, make sure your monthly spending and rewards amounts or perks will cover it. Thereâs no use in keeping a card that will cost you money just to keep it in your wallet.
How much money do you spend in the specified rewards categories? Some cards have set rewards categories, and some rotate each month or quarter. When selecting a card, consider how much money you spend in its more generous rewards category. For example, if you donât own a car, it might not be wise to choose a rewards card that touts a higher cash back reward in the gas category.
Do you travel enough to be loyal to one airline? Choosing an airline rewards card is a big commitment. While they come with big rewards and perks, airline cards can have hefty annual fees. Consider how much you travel on one specific airline before signing up for its credit card; if you only travel a few times a year, you might not utilize the additional benefits enough to justify a large annual fee.
Is it a charge card or a credit card? A charge card must be paid in full each month; a credit card, however, offers more flexibility and lets account holders carry balances. If youâre someone who has revolving debt, a charge card is not a good option.
What are the cardâs fees and penalties? If traveling is a priority for you, keep in mind that some cards charge foreign transaction fees â so youâll want to find one that doesnât. Other fees and penalties to keep in mind include late payment fees, returned check fees, etc.





Notable Cards That Didn't Make the Top 10 List
Just because a card didnât make our top 10 list doesnât mean it isnât worth mentioning. There are plenty of rewards cards out there that have great programs and bonus offers, including:
1) American Express Gold
This is a favorite among American Express rewards cards, and for good reason: The company teams up with major airlines like Delta, JetBlue, Emirates and more, making rewards redemptions easy â and points transfer at a 1:1 value. The card also comes with Amexâs signature benefits, such as travel concierge services, help with booking vacations and more.

Rewards: 4X membership points at restaurants worldwide; 4x membership points (on spending up to $25,000) at supermarkets; 3X points on flights booked directly with airlines or through American Express Travel.
Annual Fee: $250
Bonus Offer: None
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The Amex Gold card has additional perks, such as $10 monthly restaurant statement credits, $100 airline fee credit, phone insurance and more.

 
2) Capital OneÂ® VentureÂ® Rewards Credit Card
This popular travel rewards card has a generous sign-up bonus and no foreign transaction fees, meaning you can bring it wherever your next adventure takes you.

Rewards: Unlimited 2X miles per $1 on every purchase; 10X miles on hotels through January 2020 (learn more at hotels.com/venture)
Annual Fee:Â $0 for the first year, then $95
Bonus Offer: Earn 50,000 bonus miles after making $3,000 in purchases within the first three months of the account opening
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: No foreign transaction fees.

 
3) Uber Visa Card
This card is a top pick for dining, considering its high 4% rewards rate for the category. It also has a unique tie-in with Uber, letting cardholders redeem their rewards for Uber Cash. If youâre someone who loves spending weekends out on the town, this card can be a great asset.

Rewards: 4% back on dining; 3% on hotel and airfare; 2% back for online purchases; 1% back on all other purchases
Annual Fee: None
Bonus Offer: $150 cash bonus after spending $500 within the first three months of the account opening
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: Additional benefits include: Up to $600 phone damage or theft protection if you pay phone bill with the card; $50 streaming credit after $5,000 card or more in spending on the card a year.
