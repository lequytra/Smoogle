Berklee College of Music
160 Massachusetts Avenue
Boston, MA

Fronting on Massachusetts Avenue, the new multi-use residence hall for Berklee College of Music strengthens the Collegeâs multiple connections to the City of Boston. The transparent facade reveals the life of the building while creating an active urban street edge. The building includes freshman housing, a 400-seat, 2-story Dining Hall serving as a student performance venue overlooking the street, music technology studios, student activity and gathering spaces, and ground-floor retail.
