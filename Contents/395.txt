Sonoma State University
Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall
Sonoma County, CA

William Rawn Associates, Architects, Inc. acted as Project Designers for the interior of the new Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall, located at the edge of the Sonoma State University Campus. The venue doubles as the year-round home of the Santa Rosa Symphony and a summer host for the San Francisco Symphony. The venue also hosts major orchestras and performers. A set of large glass windows facing the archetypal Sonoma Hills to the east orients the 1,400-seat concert hall in its Northern California context. The hall provides a sense of intimacy for the audience and performer with warm wood detailing and the arrangement of loge boxes and two surrounding balconies. Large doors at the rear of the hall open the space onto a terraced lawn, where an audience of 3,000 peopleâall with views of the stageâcan listen to musical performances surrounded by views of Sonoma County hills.
