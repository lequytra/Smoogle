Ladies Breakfast

The Wednesday morning ladies group invites you to join them at 8 a.m. on Wednesday mornings throughout the golf season. They have coffee and rolls, play 9 holes, then grab a light lunch together. They also travel to neighboring communities to play in tournaments once/month.
During the colder months they like to terrorize the neighboring communities as attested by the pictures.
