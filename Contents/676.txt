Make/Shift offers a  space for art without rules 
Sep 19, 2019 by Arts in Article

Make/Shift is a public, arts-based creation space hosted weekly in downtown Grinnell at The Stew by Professor Jeremy Chen, senior lecturer in studio art at Grinnell College. Make/Shift âemphasizes experimentation and is less concerned about the product that comes out of that,â said Chen. âI see it as a space for possibilities and community.â The space is open on Thursdays from 7 to 9 p.m., when students can drop in to work on whatever projects they would like.
Chen created Make/Shift to break the script often seen in for-profit locales. âIâm interested in non-commercial spaces that allow public interaction and encourage creative and cultural interaction,â Chen said. âHow do you go to a space and bring your own agency to that space?â Make/Shift serves as an opportunity to create without guidelines or boundaries.
âWe have lots of spaces where people can go to buy a product, to pay for an experience,â Chen explained. âWe have fewer spaces where people from all different walks of life, different life experiences can gather and engage with less of a specific event or activity in mind.â
Grace Wallace â22 attended Make/Shift last year. Wallace said, âitâs a very relaxed environment, and itâs kind of therapeutic to sit there and make art and talk to people.â Wallace worked on various projects, from collages to a board game made fromÂ  magazines and books from the 1960s.
âIâd like to see more engagement from a very wide range of people that live in this town,â Chen said. âThat person might meet someone else that they would never meet in town otherwise.â However, attendance has always been fairly low, at around six to ten people per Thursday.
âOn Fridays, you have a lot of stuff due, you have quizzes, tests,â Lee noted. âThatâs probably why students are hesitant to take the time to go off campus.â said Tommy Lee ’22, who also attends Make/Shift.
âI think people maybe donât really know what it is, you kind of have to go for the first time to understand whatâs going on.â Wallace said.
âIâve thought about partnering with all kinds of places,â Chen said. âIâm interested more in the
College reaching out to the community or engaging with the community in different ways, and students engaging with people intergenerationally.â
Make/Shift also hosts events throughout the year to highlight different aspects of the arts community in Grinnell.
âThere was a time when the band Pink Neighbor came, and they did collages along with the students and the other people there,â Wallace said. âThey had their music playing and they were selling their merch.â
Near the beginning of last year, Make/Shift put on a puppet show directed towards a younger audience. During each of these events, there was higher-than-average attendance to Make/Shift.
Make/Shift fills a unique role in Grinnell: it serves as a space where people can embrace creative agency without a script and in an environment that relieves the pressure of judgement. There is no teacher: students, local artists and College faculty all create and learn together. Even if itâs only for two hours each week, art is freed from restraint.
