Stanford University
Hoover Institution Conference Center and Office Building
Stanford, CA

Situated at the base of the iconic Hoover Tower and adjacent to Stanford Universityâs historic main quad, the Hoover Conference Center and Office Building provides a new home for the public policy research centerâs symposia and donor retreats as well as consolidated offices for the institutionâs management and operations. The 55,000 square foot building houses a 400 person auditorium and a 440 person dining hall/multi-purpose room with a single-level suite of offices and meeting rooms on the second floor above. A glassy arcade and central pavilion space provide pre-function support for the two main function halls while connecting directly to new outdoor courtyards and the Stanford campus beyond. The project is currently in construction documentation. The Associate Architect is Cody Anderson Wasney Architects of Palo Alto, CA.
