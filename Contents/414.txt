Klarman Hall is a 1,000-seat hall designed to provide a flexible convening, presentation and collaboration space at the heart of the historic Harvard Business School campus.  Equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisual systems, comfortable seating for variable audience sizes from 300 to 600 to 1,000 and excellent acoustics for spoken word, the new building will meet the current and future demands of the schoolâs numerous conferences, lectures, education and cultural programs and performances.  As a centerpiece of the schoolâs convening infrastructure, Klarman Hall has been designed to extend HBSâs global convening footprint. The project is targeting LEED Gold certification.
