Golden Bria's Manny Villar is number 2 on the Philippines rich list.



This story is part of Forbes' coverage of Philippines' Richest 2018. See the full list here.
There's been a general lift in Philippine real estate and construction fortunes, and then there's Manny Villar. His wealth has tripled over the past year, making him now the country's second richest. Shares in his Golden Bria (formerly Golden Haven) leapt a staggering 1,300% in the first quarter, as a profitable business in burial services was joined with a new Villar vehicle for developing housing projects and condos for middle-class families. Investors saw in the mix a basis for the magnate building telecom infrastructure, an especially attractive play.




The ranking had an unusually volatile year, with 19 seeing net worths shift 20% or more, compared with just 12 last year. Ramon Ang, Inigo and Mercedes Zobel and Eduardo Cojuangco were among those on the upside, thanks to shares in their San Miguel, the country's largest beer brewer, rising 70% from a year ago. In July it announced plans to invest $1 billion in ten new breweries across the Philippines and in other countries.

Five newcomers made the list, including self-made fashion designer Josie Natori and Necisto Sytengco of chemical-trading outfit SBS Philippines. Isidro Consunji and his siblings replace their founder father, David, who died last September. Others who make their debut are William Belo of big-box chain Wilcon Depot and Jerry Liu of semiconductor maker Cirtek Holding.
The Biggest Loser
A notable 27 fortunes declined, however. Media tycoons Gilberto Duavit, Menardo Jimenez and Felipe Gozon fell as shares in their GMA Network dropped 11%. The network posted a 21% decline in earnings for the first half of 2018. The biggest loser was Betty Ang of noodle giant Monde Nissin, who shed 70% of her total on a sharp fall in net income, according to the latest available annual report.
Mining magnates Philip Ang and Luis Virata dropped off the list as the sector suffered from tighter state regulations on nickel extraction and increased competition from Indonesia.

Private companies were valued by using financial ratios and other comparisons with similar publicly traded companies.
