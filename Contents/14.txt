Grinnell Prize













        
                  Social responsibility calls for innovators of every kind.
      
  
    



Creators of sustainable agricultural technology. Champions for African childrenâs literature. Human rights advocates and natural disaster responders. The Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize â known familiarly as the Grinnell Prize â celebrates and elevates change-makers like these and all the good they do. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Creatively approaching the biggest challenges that confront society today. Bettering the world in a way we recognize as Grinnellian. Thatâs why weâre proud to honor who they are and the impact theyâre making on our world.








The Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize (the Grinnell Prize) honors individuals who have demonstrated leadership in their fields and who show creativity, commitment, and extraordinary accomplishment in effecting positive social change. Each prize carries an award of $100,000, half to the winning individual(s) and half to their related, nominated organization.
Nominations for the 2020Â Grinnell Prize will open July 1, 2019 and will be due by 11:59 p.m. on October 7, 2019.Â

ABOUT THE PRIZE 

        
                  Our institution was built by social reformers.
      
  
    

The founders of Grinnell College believed we could always do more for others. From the beginning, we have viewed our role as an institution as a responsibility to contribute to the common good. With the creation of the Grinnell Prize, weâve extended our educational mission beyond the campus and alumni community, to individuals anywhere who believe that innovative social justice programs create a better world.
