The Columbia Combined Plan program enables students to receive both a liberal arts and an engineering education, getting the best of what each educational experience has to offer. Students will receive a B.A. degree in a liberal arts field as well as a B.S. in an engineering discipline from Columbia.
The program is usually completed as a 3-2 sequence: three years in a liberal arts curriculum and two years in Columbia Engineering (with students applying in the junior year). The program may also be completed as a 4-2 sequence: four years in a liberal arts curriculum and two years in Columbia Engineering (with students applying in the senior year).
Life at Columbia
Combined Plan students can participate in undergraduate research, undergraduate student life (including groups such as Engineers Without Borders and the Engineering Student Council) and Columbia resources such as the Center for Career Education and the Center for Student Advising.
Combined Plan students are guaranteed housing during their first engineering year.Â  While Columbia will do its best to accommodate studentsâ requests to live on campus after the first year, there is no guarantee that Combined Plan students will be offered a room on campus beyond the first year. Off-Campus Housing Assistance (OCHA) can assist students in non-Columbia owned buildings.

From the Lion's Mouth 








“My academic experience at Columbia, tackling one of the most challenging series of courses that Iâve ever taken, has ultimately been extremely rewarding and revolutionary. Iâve become a stronger, more capable student because of it.”
