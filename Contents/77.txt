1
		Wikimedia projects belong to everyone	

You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio, or copy/paste it into your homework.




2
		We respect your data and privacy	

We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy, andÂ data retention guidelines.




3
		People like you keep Wikipedia accurate	

Readers verify the facts. Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources, so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help.




4
		Not all wikis are Wikimedia	

The word âwikiâ refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use "wiki" in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.

Norway and Armenia come together to bring Bodil BiÃ¸rn’s historic photographs online



Over 180 memories of Armenian history are now available to everyone in the world, free of charge, thanks to a collaborative project between Wikimedia Norge (Norway), Wikimedia Armeniaâboth independent Wikimedia affiliate organizationsâand the National Archives of Norway.

			Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures. The internet has become the default for accessing informationâwomen, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.
