Espresso Book Machine

 Prints a book faster than you can make a cup of coffee

The Espresso Book Machine (the  "EBM ") is an ATM for books. Once you select your title and hit the buy button, the EBM will print, bind and trim your book with a full-color cover within minutes at the bookstore or library of your choosing. The book is indistinguishable from paperback books sold at bookstores. And the EBM is a green machine since it only prints what is sold thereby eliminating  shipping, returns and the pulping of unwanted books.
