Community FeedbackSince EYP was selected to work with the campus community in early 2015, more than 200 campus meetings, forums, workshops, and feedback sessions have been held to solicit input and refine design. Topics included the Collegeâs commitments to accessibility, environmental sustainability, and the preservation and revitalization of existing iconic buildings.February 1

EYP is the architecture firm selected for the Humanities and Social Studies Center. McGough Construction is the building contractor. ASG is the design firm chosen for both the Admission/Financial Aid Center and the Comprehensive Landscape, Entry, and Wayfinding project.
Work on the Humanities and Social Studies Center is in the design development stage (as of July 2016). Preparatory site work began immediately following Reunion in June. Actual construction will begin in the first quarter of 2017.
In June 2016, the corner of 8th Avenue and Park Street was named as the Admission/Financial Aid Centerâs future site. Decisions are forthcoming concerning relocation of existing structures and alternative accommodations for the CRSSJ and other student and program occupants.
Design work for the College Comprehensive Landscape, Entry, and Wayfinding project is under way and will include designs for a cohesive flow from campus into the zone of confluence between campus and the city of Grinnell.
Construction timelines for the latter two projects are not yet fully developed.
