Dartmouth Engineer article: Schools of Thought


The dual-degree program is for students at other liberal arts colleges who want to study engineering at Dartmouth. You'll spend your junior or senior year at Dartmouth, receive your bachelor's degree from your home school, and then return to Dartmouth to complete a fifth year of engineering studies in Thayer School's Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program.
A Dartmouth academic year has three 12-weeks terms. The Dartmouth academic calendar includes 4 terms — fall, winter, spring, and summer. You can begin your first year at Dartmouth in the summer, fall, or winter term of your junior or senior year. When you return for your BE year, you'll begin classes in the fall term.
After your first year at Dartmouth, you may want to pursue an internship. Contact Thayer School Career Services for information about engineering internships. Career Services will also help you find a job after you finish the BE degree.
Learn more about the dual-degree program (PDF).
See slides (PDF) from the dual-degree information webinar (presented on August 21, 2014) for more details about the program.
