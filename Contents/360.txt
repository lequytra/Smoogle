Duke University
Keohane 4 Residence Hall
Durham, NC

This 150-bed sophomore through senior residence hall immediately adjacent to Dukeâs historic gothic West Campus fosters interaction within smaller residential communities. Taking advantage of the campusâ steep topography, each âhouseâ (60 and 90 persons) has their own front door. Near the entry at each house is a two-story House Lounge featuring wide and open stairs to encourage informal gathering and foster connections between floors. 

The two-story all glass Multi-Purpose Room - open to all students - activates the quad and the pathway connecting one residential precinct to another. Each house is equipped with a range of unit types, from doubles and singles to suites and duplex suites, to meet the needs of this multi-year community. (75,000 SF, Completed 2012)
