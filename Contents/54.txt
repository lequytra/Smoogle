IOWA COLLEGE. The oldest collegiate
institution in the State of Iowa, founded in 1846 
by an association of Congregationalists and
Presbyterians at Davenport, and incorporated in the 
following year. The college was opened in 1848, 
and in 1859 it was removed to its present situation
in Grinnell. The institution includes three 
departments, the college, the academy, and the 
school of music, since 1857 open to both sexes. 
In 1895 the collegiate courses were arranged on 
the group system, and lead to the degrees of B.A.
and B.Ph. The college grounds include a campus 
of twenty-two acres, a park of four acres, and an 
athletic field of fourteen acres. There are six 
college buildings, valued in 1902 at $175,000. 
In that year the endowment was $360,000, with 
an income of $47,000. The library contained 30,000
volumes. The faculty numbered 37, and the 
attendance was 456, including 9 graduate
students, 294 students in the college, 103 in the 
academy, and 87 in the school of music.
