The most common way to measure a college's return-on-investment (ROI) is to look at the percent of students securing employment after graduation, and then review their average salaries. Of course, this method favors whichever colleges out there are catering to the latest employment trends--think STEM-focused schools, or those in urban locations with COOP programs. Nothing wrong with that.
But a return on a college education is more than just a 4-year vocational exercise. Great colleges produce happy and successful alumni--who give back in droves. In fact, I consider this to be the core competency of excellent colleges. Financial support from a school's "end product" is what helps to sustain great institutions in perpetuity and allow it to flourish academically.

With this in mind, I developed a simple alternative measure for college ROI that we call Forbes Grateful Graduates Index. This metric ranks private not-for-profit colleges with more than 1,000 students by analyzing two important variables: median private donations and gifts per student over 10 years, as reported to the Department of Education; and the Alumni Participation Rate, or the percentage of graduates that give back in the form of donations to their colleges each year-- regardless of the dollar amount. This measure, from the Council for Aid To Education, is averaged over 3 years. Because it measures percentage instead of dollars, it gives smaller nurturing liberal arts schools like Wellesley College, Davidson College, and Carelton College a leg up in ROI. The private donation per student figure gets a 75% weighting in our index and the alumni participation percentage gets a 25% weighting. 
The top two spots continue to go to the smallest Ivy Leagues, Dartmouth College and Princeton University, where deep-pocketed alums show their love each year by writing large checks.  Surprisingly, several "hot" colleges on our list, including New York University, Georgetown University and George Washington University score poorly from an alumni giveback measure.

Below you will find 2017's ranking.
