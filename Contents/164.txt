Confidence From the Ground Up
It takes the effort of hundreds and sometimes thousands of people to bring together the vision, expertise and materials to build any structure. McGough is proud of our role in that process – and we’re proud of the results. As a respected general contractor, we bring six generations of experience to prominent, distinctive and complex construction projects. Our people and their expertise in planning, development, construction and facility management power our success.
From new construction to renovation – with world-class architects and trusted subcontractors – McGough has a history of collaboration and partnership that leverages the power of people and the advantage of cross-functional expertise. We have worked in diverse spaces including corporate, industrial, healthcare, institutional, housing, education, worship, performing arts and retail.
Whether your project is large or small, start with confidence from the ground up.
