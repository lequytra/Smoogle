                  Internship Funding
      
  


        


Current first-, second-, and third-year students may apply for funding to offset the costs of food, transportation, and housing for an 8- to 10-week, full-time unpaid or underpaid internship. The internship must be secured at the time of application.
Funding opportunities are competitive, and look for clarity in presentation, support from the sponsoring organization, academic preparation, and a link to the applicant's interests. They also call for well-defined responsibilities, originality, uniqueness of the internship opportunity, and a clear fit within the specific funding criteria.
Additional information about internship funding is available on GrinnellShare (secure login required).

Ragnar ThorissonÂ â11 Service and Social Innovation (SSI) Project Grants
The CLS offers funding to support collaborative service and social justice projects in and around the Grinnell community. When applying for funding, students are encouraged to think about the context in which they are doing service. Each project should not only address the symptoms of the challenge students are addressing, but also be conscious of the systemic issues that contribute to the challenge itself.Â 
Service and Social Innovation (SSI) Transportation Grant
This grant offers carpool funding and logistics for groups of at least two students in need of transportation to a volunteer site. The CLS works together with the College's Facilities Management Office to schedule carpool drivers and vehicles.Â 
Additional information about service and social Innovation grants is available on GrinnellShare (secure login required).Â
