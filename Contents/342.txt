William Rawn Associates is committed to buildings participating in the
civic or public realmâbuildings in the city or buildings in important public
landscape settings. We believe that successful architecture, through the
active engagement of its civic context, fosters the values of diversity,
meritocracy, and participation that are fundamental to the American
democratic experience.
