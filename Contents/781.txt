                  Grinnellians turn outward and let the world in.
      
  
    



In fact, we approach every question or situation with this wide-open attitude. Because when you come to know other perspectives, you can better understand the events that shaped history, as well as whatâs before you and whatâs beyond your view. Itâs how you learn to thrive in all kinds of settings and make lifelong connections across the globe.




























The Institute for Global Engagement

        
                  The driving engine for global opportunities, both on campus and beyond.
      
  
    

Off-campus study. Collaboration across departments. Linking campus programs with research efforts, language learning, cultural events, and everything in between. For students and faculty, the Institute of Global Engagement works to advance global initiatives that are well known to Grinnellians, and those on coming up the horizon.

At Grinnell, you donât have to wait until your junior year to travel abroad. Through the Global Learning Program, first- and second-year students can explore specific international issues through interdisciplinary study. Then, over a three-week period, you and your classmates will visit two or more countries, regions, or ecosystems, diving further into the issues youâve examined back on campus.


Take a Trip












Off-Campus Study

        
                  Semester-Long Study Abroad
      
  
    

The longer you spend in a country, the better youâre able to unpack its history, form meaningful connections, and acquire new understanding for societies different from your own. Thatâs why 55% of Grinnellians complete some sort of off-campus study, many of them for a full semester. Your experiences abroad can play a critical role in launching new chapters in your academic journey and uncovering intellectual paths you didnât even know were out there.


Take your Time












The Language Learning Center

        
                  Speaking of new ways of seeing the world, letâs talk. 
      
  
    

Our academic community comes to campus from all over the globe. This exchange of knowledge and culture offers you the perfect chance to explore new languages with expert faculty and students. At the Language Learning Center, you can pursue a long list of language options, starting with Ancient Greek, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Latin, Russian, Spanish, and more.
