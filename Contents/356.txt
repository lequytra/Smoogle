Trinity College
Summit Residence Hall and Court
Hartford, CT

The New Summit Residence Halls provide beds for 173 students, combining three resident "houses" around a cohesive quadrangle. The first set of buildings constructed under a new Master Plan, the Complex follows a strategy of filling in missing teeth at the campus edges and strengthening the existing campus pattern of quadrangles (87,000 s.f.; 173 beds).
