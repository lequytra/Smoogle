      Grinnellians Ask Hard Questions and Question Easy Answers.
See Why






















        
                  Curiosity can take you anywhere.
      
  
    



This is more than a place, and much bigger than an idea. Grinnell is a way of being and seeing. Itâs an unwavering commitment to the journey of discovery, both in everything we want to do and everything we want to become.








      No two journeys are the same. In fact, we've designed it that way.

Welcome to the world of intellectual freedom. Here, you're in charge of how your studies take shape and where you want them to take you.












        
                  How We Learn
      
  
    

Free inquiry is no easy feat. You'll think critically and creatively about the world around you. You'll dive deep into theoretical and scientific research. You'll work alongside world-class experts, advisers, and mentors who are dedicated to your success.


Define your direction.













        
                  Why We're Here
      
  
    

This is bigger than a degree. Youâre at Grinnell to discover what you want to do and what you can do for this world. To move issues of purpose, responsibility, and social justice beyond conversation and into tangible action. To build a career that matters, before even leaving campus.


Make your mark.













        
                  Who We Are
      
  
    

We come from all over. We study all sides. Across our open community, youâll find weâre not afraid to step into unfamiliar conversations, challenging perspectives, or countries far away from home.


Grow to know us.











        
                  Grinnellian Stories
      
  
    






 





Grinnell was really the first place where I actually had the chance, or the self-awareness, to pursue somethingÂ thatÂ was a little bit out of my comfort zone.


        
                  Mithila Iyer â19
      
  
    

Meet Mithila






 





I would definitely credit that experience with helping me to have a persuasive application and making me want to do this type of work.

Meet Nathan






 





We went through the fire, went through the ice, and I learned how to come out stronger. Iâm a resilient Grinnellian.
