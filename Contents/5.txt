Academics
A commitment to the common good is the overarching theme of Grinnell College, a private liberal arts school in Iowa. With âan articulated commitment to social responsibility,â students can choose from more than five hundred courses each year and more than eighty study abroad options. âAcademics here are difficult,â but âclasses are also in-depth and engagingâ and âGrinnell has great support systemsâ should you find any course to be too challenging. And while professors âmay make you work hard, they are just as committed to helping you as you are to trying.â They have âa deep understanding of both their subject material and how to teach itâ and are âwilling to take substantial time to make sure individual students are keeping up.â Many classes are based on âengaging, thought-provoking discussionâ (including language classes) and professors âknow how to pivot any student response for productive discussion,â often incorporating creative learning methods to do so. âMy political science class featured extensive political theory games run by the professor [such as] designing nations, playing as competing social movements, [and] trying to keep others from polluting common resources,â says a student. Each professor âlets their personality shine through lectures and class discussion,â and âyou will [quickly] learn which professors speak to your interests, and you will likely stick with them.â


Student Body
This is a âmotivated, vibrant, interesting and interested, and â¦ very, very smartâ group of students. On top of being âunpretentious and down-to-earth,â they also tend âto be passionately [in favor of] social justice.â In pursuit of that, Grinnellians are âvery curious peopleâ and âare usually busy and working on some combination of academic and extracurricular projects.â With a âcommon interest of learning and being intellectually stimulated as well as being critical of societal practices and other big picture problems occurring today,â this is a âvery inclusive environmentâ where âresistance to unique expression is often looked down upon.â To that extent, âall students are invited to any on campus or off campus event.â One student says, âEveryone can find their tribe here.â Another puts the student body in perspective: âThere [must] be something different about you if youâre willing to trek to rural Iowa for your undergrad education.â


Campus Life
There are âlots of niche interestsâ here and thereâs a club for almost every one of themâthereâs even âNerf at Noyce, which is the club dedicated to spending Friday nights in the enormous science building playing giant games with Nerf guns.â With options like that, âbasically every student is involved in some extracurricular activities.â However, âstudying will take a good portion of the weekdaysâ at this âalways busyâ school, so âfun is usually reserved for the weekends, which are full of socializing and club activities.â Students note that when itâs warmer out, âstudents can be seen LARPing [live action role-playing] outside on the field, or playing Frisbee with a group of friends.â Outside of those on-campus activities, âyou better be creative and active in searching for/creating your own fun, because Grinnell is no metropolis.â And while there arenât a lot of events in Grinnell, âthere are a variety of locations off campus (pubs, bars, bowling alleys, farms, restaurants, and parks)â where students can also decompress.

Students Say


Grinnell undergrads do pretty well for themselves.  Indeed, according to PayScale.com, the average starting salary for these students is $48,800. Students are thankful that the âGrinnell College alumni...are very proactive in providing students with assistance in the form of... employment, or mentorship.â And, even if undergrads are unable to hook up with an alum, they can always turn to the Center for Careers, Life and Service (CLS). Besides interview prep, job shadowing programs, and on-campus recruiting, the center also houses the Service Learning and Civic Engagement Program, which helps students find co-curricular service learning opportunities. Grinnellink internships are specific (and paid!) opportunities with college alumni and friends and are open exclusively to Grinnell students. Off-campus study experiences, whether abroad like Grinnell-in-London, or at a U.S. location like Grinnell-in Washington, offer more ways for experiential learning to complement coursework.

Sustainability


Long known for its academic excellence, Iowaâs Grinnell College distinguishes itself equally as a leader in college sustainability practices. The college has declared that the new buildings Grinnell constructs will be built to at least LEED Silver certification. Existing LEED certified buildings include an Athletic Center that collects runoff rainwater for recycling and geothermally heats and cools its facilities, a dining hall that composts all food and paper waste, and a Science Center with heat recovery laboratory exhaust systems and a rainwater-irrigated greenhouse. Grinnell residence halls provide single stream recycling containers for all renewable materials. One administrator adds that the college âhas dedicated one of its student houses as an Ecohouse and will use that house to demonstrate green technologies, energy conservation, water conservation, and local foods to the Grinnell community.â Grinnell similarly offers a host of academic and extracurricular options for students interested in applied sustainability learning. Notably, the collegeâs Center for Prairie Studies coordinates the Grinnell Area Local Foods Alliance, takes advantage of Grinnellâs rich history in Iowa to cultivate unique, location-specific agricultural, historical, and public affairs internships for students, and connects students with environmental opportunities at local farms, foundations, and other sustainable organizations. Grinnell allows students to create dynamic and interdisciplinary academic concentrations in environmental studies, global development studies, and policy studies, all of which address sustainability issues.
