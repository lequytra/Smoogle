Shane, his wife Lisa, and their 4 children have called Grinnell home for the last 10 years. Â He has a sales and service background, and strives to ensure his customer’s expectations are being exceeded at all timesÂ (Link). Â If you don’t find him at the course (which is quite rare), you’ll find him assisting on several local boards or helping with youth sports programs.
Shane is responsible for the overall operations of Grinnell College Golf Course. This includes the 56 acres of green space, pub, pro shop, pool, Â and 3800 SqFt events space.
