If youâre someone who lives for bonus points, this is the card for you. The World of Hyatt card offers bonus points on everything from fitness clubs to Ubers. So if you spend $50 a month on Uber, $200 a month on restaurants and $50 a month on a gym membership, youâll earn 7,200 points – enough for one free night at a Hilton hotel. Free nights start at 5,000 points.
Rewards: Earn four points for every dollar spent at Hyatt hotels, restaurants and spas; two points for every dollar spent restaurants, on airline tickets purchased directly from the airline, local transit and commuting as well as fitness club and gym memberships; and one point per every dollar spent everywhere else
Annual Fee: $95 per year
Bonus Offer: Earn 25,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in your first three months after opening your account. Earn an additional 25,000 bonus points after you spend $6,000 total on purchases within the first six months after opening your account
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: In addition to free Hyatt stays, rewards accumulated on this card can be redeemed for airlines miles at Delta, United and other airlines, and experiences like yoga, cheese tastings and bicycle tours.
Youâll also earn one free hotel stay every year after your cardmember anniversary, and one additional free night if you spend $15,000 each year.
While Marriott does offer more opportunities to advance in status level, this Hyatt card still offers some. Youâll automatically receive âDiscoveristâ status with this card, meaning youâll be able to get late checkout and bonus points for Avis car rentals, among other perks. Each year, you will automatically receive credit for five nights toward the next level of elite status, plus two additional qualifying night credits toward the next tier every time you spend $5,000.
The bottom line: Unless you exclusively stay at Hyatt hotels, the credit cards listed above offer better bonus offers.




IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card

Best for Frequenters of Holiday Inn and Candlewood Suites 

IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card
The IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card is a must-have for road warriors shelling out big bucks on IHG properties. The free Platinum status boosts the rewards on IHG purchases to stratospheric heights, and the free night and other perks easily justify the annual fee. For those who aren't IHG fans, we suggest looking elsewhere.

Plus, earn 10,000 bonus points after you spend $20,000 on purchases and make one additional purchase each account anniversary year.        

 
The IHG Rewards Club Premier credit card* has one of the lowest annual fees for a premier card, but not by much. At $89 per year, it offers the most bonus points per amount spent than any other card on this list.
Rewards: Earn ten points for every dollar spent at more than 5,300 IHG hotels; earn two points for every dollar spent on gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants; and earn one point per every dollar spent everywhere else
Annual Fee: $89 per year
Bonus Offer: Earn 125,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in your first three months after opening your account.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: This card offers no foreign transaction fees and up to $100 in credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fees every four years. It also offers a free hotel night every year, as well as a fourth hotel stay night free if you book an IHG hotel for four or more nights.
You can also earn 10,000 bonus points if you spend $20,000 a year, which is a relatively high sum compared to other hotel credit cards. Like most other hotel-branded cards, points can be redeemed for airline miles at more than 200 airlines, rental cars and concerts, as well as free hotel stays.
Card members automatically receive Platinum Elite status, which allows complimentary room upgrades and a 50% bonus earning on top of base points.
If you are discouraged by the $89 annual fee, IHG does offer a cheaper IHG Rewards Club Traveler credit card*, with a $29 annual fee. However, it only offers half of the points on spending at IHG hotels.
