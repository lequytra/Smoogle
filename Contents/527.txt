To the best of our knowledge, all content is accurate as of the date posted, though offers contained herein may no longer be available. 
Credit card issuers sure want your business. As the competition among card issuers has intensified in recent years, theyâve offered an array of incentives, including 0% APR introductory rates and most notably, sign-up bonuses in the form of cash, miles or points.

Over the past several weeks we evaluated dozens of credit cards that are currently offering welcome bonuses. Our analysis revealed several things:

Miles and Points Beat Cash: The richest bonuses come in the form of miles or points.
Valuing Miles and Points is Challenging: Weâve found plenty of âstudiesâ on the value of points and miles. The fact is, the value changes based on how and when the rewards are used.
Business Cards Beat Personal Credit Cards: By and large, the best sign-up bonuses are tied to small business credit cards. Personal credit cards offer enticing bonuses, but they tend to fall short when compared to business cards.
Offers Change Frequently: As we prepared this story, several cards changed their sign-up bonus offers. Weâve found that card issuers will run special promotions with elevated rewards.
There Are Spend Requirements: To receive a promised sign-up bonus, a new card holder must meet a set spending requirement, typically $500 to $3,000, within a set period, typically 3 months.

Weâve categorized these sign-off offers into the following bonus types:

Cash Back
General Travel
Airline Miles
Hotel Points
Small Business

As you look at the list and consider which card or cards you want, remember to look for a credit card that fits your lifestyle. If you donât travel much, then a travel credit card with a high annual fee might be a waste of your money, even with an attractive sign-up bonus. On the other hand, we all can use cash. So, if youâre looking for a new card, check out the attractive cash-back bonuses.
Itâs important to mention that you may not be eligible for certain sign-up rewards if you have received a bonus offer from an institution before. TD Bank clearly states in its Terms and Conditions brochure that if youâve already received a promotion with them, then you will not receive the current promotion (even if itâs a new and different account).

Methodology
We have a simple process at Forbes Advisor. We looked for credit card sign-up bonuses that were high in value and attached to practical and usable rewards programs. We made sure you could redeem your bonus mileage for at least a one-way flight. We translated points and miles into dollars using our own estimates of value, along with information provided by the issuers and other sources.

Sign-Up Bonus: Up to $250
Review: The bonus you can receive by spending $1,000 in the first three months of having this card is one of the most competitive cashback deals out there. Plus, you donât have to pay interest on balances for purchases and transfers for 12 months. I like those features. I also donât mind that you can only use your cashback towards statement credits (as opposed to getting a check) because if helps you pay down your balance. However, I do mind that Amex is free to change the way you can redeem the reward. In the fine print Amex gives itself full permission to replace statement credits for gift cards and merchandise only. No, that probably wonât happen. But itâs still annoying that Amex limits the consumerâs options (remember, no checks for your cash back), but not its own.
Annual fee: $95
Introductory APR: 0% on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months
How Do You Get the Bonus: Spend at least $1,000 in purchases within 3 months
Redeem Rewards: Cashback is earned in the form of Amex reward dollars. The dollars can only be redeemed for statement credits and you can only redeem reward dollars above $25. At Amexâs discretion, however, it can change the redemption of reward dollars from statement credits to gift cards or merchandise
Additional Card Benefits:

6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets / 6% cash back on select subscription services / 3% on transit / 3% on gas stations / 1% on all other purchases
Receive cashback on up to $6,000 on all purchases, annually. At the 6% rate, thatâs $360 in statement credit and at the 3% rate thatâs $180.

Sign-Up Bonus: $300 cash bonus (10% cash back) after you spend $3000 in the first 3 months, 8% cash back at Vivid Seats (ends May 2020) and a waived annual fee the first year
Review: Could this be a credit card for the foodies out there? TheÂ Capital One SavorÂ card offers 4% cashback on dining so I think this works for people who prefer dining out over cooking at home. The rest of the cashback is standard, but I like that thereâs no foreign transaction fee, so you can use it wherever you are.

Review: Chaseâs travel cards are well-known among American travelers. For $95 a year you get the ability to earn frequent flyer miles on your purchases and then put those miles towards select mileage programs like Jet Blue or British Airways, or towards hotel reward programs such as those from IHG, Marriott and Hyatt. Even though Chase is popular with globe trotters, itâs still offering a welcome bonus. Newcomers who spend at least $4,000 in three months will get 60,000 points, which can get you a few nights in a hotel or a roundtrip domestic flight.
Annual fee: $95
APR: No introductory rate
How Do You Get the Bonus: Spend $4,000 within three months after opening the account and Chase will give you 60,000 points. For someone interested in using this card for travel rewards, those bonus points can be redeemed for up to $750 in travel. Normally, 100 points would equal .01 cents. When points are redeemed for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards, cardholders get 25% more in value, raising the redemption value for 100 points to .0125.
Redeem Rewards: You can transfer points to frequent flyer miles as a 1-point-to-1-mile value. Frequent flyer programs that accept this include Aer Lingus, AerClub, British Airways Executive Club, Flying Blue Air France KLM, Iberia Plus, JetBlue TrueBlue, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer, Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards, United MileagePlus and Virgin Atlantic Flying Club. Hotel reward programs that accept this include IHG Rewards Club, Marriott Bonvoy and World of Hyatt. You can also use points towards Apple products and to shop ChaseâsÂ online store.

Sign-Up Bonus: 80,000 bonus points ($1,000 in travel redemption through Chase Ultimate Rewards)
Review: The Chase Ink Business Preferred credit card has a standard annual fee that gets you 1-to-1, point-to-mileage transfers with its airline partners and travel protection (or insurance) plans. Cardholders earn points on basic overhead expenses like shipping, internet, phone and advertising. New cardholders get 80,000 bonus points when they spend $5,000 within 3 months. Thatâs the highest spending amount on this list with less perks than the CitiBusiness and Barclays small business cards.
This card works better as a supplement to your personal Chase credit cards so you can maximize the rewards. The other small business credit cards on this list offer more perks for around the same annual fee and have smaller spending requirements.
Annual fee: $95
Introductory APR: None
How Do You Get the Bonus: Spend $5,000 in the first three months
Redeem Rewards: Points increase by 25% when redeeming them for travel, which is how 80,000 points can afford you up $1,000 towards travel through Chaseâs platform. You can redeem points for cash back in the form of a statement credit or a cash deposit into a checking or savings account.
Additional Card Benefits:

Free employee cards
3 points per dollar spent on travel, shipping purchases, internet, cable, phone and advertising services.
1 Chase transfers to 1 point/mile
Travel and purchase protection plans
20,000 points for a referral

Sign-Up Bonus: 60,000 miles and a waived annual fee for the first year
Review: American Airlines has a branded small business credit card with Barclays thatâs offering 75,000 bonus miles, but its branded card with CitiBusiness is offering 60,000 bonus miles at the same spending threshold. You even get many of the same perks such as preferred boarding and a free checked bag. So, this comes down to whatâs more convenient for you. If you are already a Citibank customer, then thereâs no need to look at Barclayâs for this card.
Annual fee: $99
Introductory APR: None
How Do You Get the Bonus: Spend $3,000 in 3 months
Redeem Rewards:Â Use points to book flights with American Airlines and its sister lines, hotel stays, rent a car and plan vacations (including activities). You can also use points towards cabin upgrades; products like gift cards; services like identity theft protection; to buy membership into the Admirals Club and to make donations.
Additional Card Benefits:

2 miles per $1 spent on cable and satellite providers / 2 miles on AA purchases / 2 miles on gas / 2 miles on telecommunication merchants / 2 miles on car rentals / 1 mile for all other purchases
First checked bag is free
Preferred boarding for domestic American Airline flights and Zone 2 boarding for US Airways
AA Companion Ticket (receive an additional ticket for a guest (fees apply): a thank you gift for big spenders who can charge at least $30,000/ year to the card.
