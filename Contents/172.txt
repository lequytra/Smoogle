Grinnell College Nondiscrimination Statement of Policy
Grinnell College is committed to establishing and maintaining a safe and nondiscriminatory educational and working environment for all College community members. It is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination in matters of admission, employment, and housing, and in access to and participation in its education programs, services, and activities. The College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, veteran status, pregnancy, childbirth, religion, disability, creed or any other protected class. Discrimination and harassment on any of the bases covered by state or federal antidiscrimination statutes is unlawful and a violation of Grinnell College policy.
Grinnell College recognizes that harassment can relate to an individual's membership in more than one protected class. Targeting individuals on the basis of their membership in any protected class is also a violation of Grinnell's Community Standards and Responsibilities and may violate the College's Hate Crime and Bias-Motivated Incident Policy. Under these circumstances, the College will coordinate the investigation and resolution, provided that doing so does not unduly delay prompt and equitable resolution under this policy.
This policy prohibits sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence against Grinnell College community members of any gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. This policy also prohibits gender-based harassment that does not involve conduct of a sexual nature.
The College has grievance procedures for any individual who has experienced harassment or discrimination and wishes to pursue resolution.
