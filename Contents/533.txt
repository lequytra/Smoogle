The Best Airline Credit Cards of September 2019
By Brandon Bycer contributor



    Editorial Note: Forbes adheres to strict editorial integrity standards. The content on this page may contain partner offers and/or affiliate links, and Forbes may receive compensation if you click through a link on this page.  To the best of our knowledge, all content is accurate as of the date posted, though offers contained herein may no longer be available. Choosing an airline rewards credit card is like declaring your Facebook relationship status.Â  You are making a commitment to a specific airline (or, if you are bold enough, several airlines).Â  Airlines truly love these customers.
These customers become their brand evangelists with not only what they say but also how much they spend.Â  On every flight, you will hear the entire crew thank those members who are credit cardholders for that airline.Â  To make these relationships the best for you, the airlineâs guest, I have provided recommendations for the best airline rewards credit cards currently available.
In my recommendations, I focus on the retained benefits of the card â not the welcome offers.Â  The welcome offers are enticing invitations to become a cardholder.Â  But those offers vary seasonally.Â  In my opinion, the retained benefits are what define the cards worth my recommendations.
In concert with the retained benefits, I also did not consider the APRs for finance charges or balance transfers.Â  Those rates vary depending on the cardholderâs credit rating and card issuer, making comparisons difficult.Â  Further, those who carry a balance from month to month should consider other credit cards.Â  Paying finance charges can erase the benefits of airline rewards cards.
Lastly, as an airline rewards credit cardholder, I carry or have carried several of these cards.Â  IÂ  currently hold theÂ Alaska Airlines Visa Card and theÂ United TravelBank Card.Â  I was formerly a holder of the Gold Delta SkyMiles Card from American Express.Â  Before becoming a cardholder of theÂ United TravelBank Card, I originally owned aÂ United Explorer CardÂ and traded down to theÂ United MileagePlus Rewards Card*Â before switching to United TravelBank Card.

No Annual Fee Airline Rewards Cards
Airlines have recently introduced no annual fee card options.Â  The airline rewards credit card marketplace has made a concerted effort to reach out to younger or starter travelers (i.e. Millennials). According to aÂ 2016 Bankrate survey, only 33% of those ages 18-29 owned a credit card.Â  Additionally, aÂ 2018 NextAdvisor surveyÂ found that Millennials (ages 18-37) were more likely to express confusion about credit card rewards than older adults.
So with these new airline rewards cards, loyal frequent flyers can add an airline reward credit card without worrying about the burden of an annual fee.Â  The following four cards are the only of this kind currently available.




Best Annual Fee Airline Rewards Cards
Many airlines offer an assortment of credit cards, much like how some automobile companies market multiple brands.Â  Each automakerâs brand is marketed to a specific customer segment.Â  The same applies to airline reward credit cards.Â  Consider an airlineâs no annual fee card option as similar to a Honda and its annual fee-based option as an Acura.
In other cases the Volkswagen Group, with its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti brands, is a more apt comparison, since the airline offers a vast array of credit card options, sometimes more focused on the higher end.Â  In that explanation, you can understand that the airlinesÂ have invested far more historically in their depthÂ of credit cards to further the relationship with their most loyal customers.Â  One airline, Alaska Airlines, offers only one credit card across their frequent flyer program.Â  Southwest Airlines offers multiple credit cards, all with an annual fee.
In terms of the big three airlines (Delta, United, and American),Â Delta AirlinesÂ currently has open applications for four personal credit cards, three of which charge annual fees.
Figure 1:Â  Delta Airlinesâ Assortment of SkyMiles Credit Cards with American Express (courtesy of Delta Airlines)
UnitedÂ has three options â two charging annual fees.Â  American Airlines publicly offers four personal credit cards to new customers (three issued from CitiÂ andÂ one from Barclays Bank).Â  On theirÂ AAdvantage website, the airline maintains information for as many as eight personal credit cards.Â  Thereâs a reason for the dual issuers: before their merger in December 2013, US Airways issued its credit cards via Barclays, whileÂ  American issued their cards via Citi. While the US Airways brand disappeared inÂ  2015, the legacy of dual bank issuers lives on.Â  All the AA cards are maintained through anÂ exclusive agreement with Mastercard.
The most elite cards from these three airlines cost $400 or more a year and include club access and a higher-earning base rate than their lower-tiered options, as well as a host of benefits similar to those offered by their cheaper siblings.Â  Therefore, unless you are the most loyal of supporters for a specific airline, itâs best to focus your efforts on selecting a credit card with either no annual fee or aÂ  lowone.
My four recommended airline rewards cards with an annual fee are the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card, the Alaska Airlines Visa Card, the JetBlue Plus Card, and the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Priority Card.Â  With the greater diversity of cards with an annual fee, each requires its own specific description (the only similar benefit is a free checked bag for the cardholder).

The United TravelBank Card*Â is the most unique airlines reward card with or without an annual fee.Â  This card rewards you in dollars towards a future United flight â not miles for redemption.Â  This card rewards 1.5% in âTravelBank cashâ on all purchases (or 2% when used to purchase a United flight). You can use TravelBank cash for payment towards a future flight.Â  The 1.5% base earning rate is higher than all other no annual fee card options from other airlines (all others are 1x miles per dollar).
The card offers a 25% savings for inflight purchases, much like the other no annual fee rewards cards, and no foreign transaction fees.Â  As a cardholder, you are able to redeem miles earned from travel or from purchases in theÂ MileagePlus XÂ app, at reduced levels â a benefit available to all United Airlines credit cardholders.Â  Also, the TravelBank card is a Visa Signature card.Â  As such, you enjoy the benefits of many credit cards that require an annual fee such as trip cancellation/interruption insurance.




American Airlines AAdvantage MileUp Card

Best Airline Card for Elite Status 

American Airlines AAdvantage MileUp Card
This card makes sense for a narrow range of people: Casual AA fliers seeking a no-annual-fee card with moderate rewards and with no need to carry a balance. To maximize rewards earnings, spend on AA purchases and groceries to score 2x miles. The 3% foreign transaction fee and a lack of perks will turn off frequent international travelers.

The other three no annual fee airline rewards credit cards are all of similar flavor.Â  American AirlinesâÂ AAdvantageÂ MileUpÂ Mastercard, Delta AirlinesâÂ Blue Delta SkyMiles Card, and JetBlue AirwaysâÂ JetBlue CardÂ all earn miles/points towards future travel redemption.Â  Each card earns a base of 1x mile (or point) per dollar spent, 2x mile per dollar spent for some specific purchase category (American for grocery stores, Delta for restaurants, and JetBlue for both grocery stores and restaurants) and for actually booking a flight with the airline â except for JetBlue.The JetBlue Card adds one extra wrinkle.Â  You get 3x points per dollar when booking JetBlue travel.

TheÂ Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit CardÂ takes some of the best elements from the aforementioned cards.Â  At $195 annually, the card is in the mid-range of fees on Deltaâs credit card products.Â  This card includes an annual companion certificate for a domestic trip each year upon renewal.Â  Also, heavy card users can earn elite-qualifying miles annually (10,000 tier-qualifying miles (MQMs) for every $25,000 spent annually, up to twice per year).
The credit card spend benefit, termed Miles Boost, counts towards the tier-qualifying spend waiver to achieve elite status, too.Â  Cardholders who spend more than $25,000 annually have theÂ Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQDs) requirement waived for most elite statuses.Â  As Gold status begins after earning 25,000 MQMs, if a cardholder spends $50,000 annually, that SkyMiles member needs only 5,000 MQMs from air travel to earn elite status.
The card also offers all the essentials of no foreign transaction fees, priority boarding (only one of those on our shortlist), and a higher earning rate for purchases of Delta products (flights, inflight purchases, etc. â 2x miles per dollar).Â  Unlike JetBlue and Southwest, this card does not offer an annual anniversary bonus.Â  This card is similar to the Alaska Airlines Visa Card with some additional and valuable âbells-and-whistlesâ.

Alaska Airlinesâ only credit cardÂ offers a higher earning rate for purchases of air travel on the airline compared to Delta and Southwest.Â  At 3x miles per dollar with the purchase of an Alaska Airlines flight and no foreign transaction fees, you can earn miles faster. Moreover, you can redeem those extra miles for flights on Alaska Airlines itself or any of their Alaska Global Partner carriers, too â so long as you redeem through Alaska Airlinesâ site. As Alaska Airlines is not part of an alliance (such as the OneWorld, SkyTeam, or Star Alliance),Â  each of these partner airlines has a specific agreement with Alaska Airlines directly â similar to JetBlue Airways and its airline partners.
Alaska Airlinesâ Mileage PlanÂ has been ranked as the best frequent flyer program. Among other selling points, it is the last remaining major airline in the United States on which frequent flyer members earn miles based on distance flown, as opposed to the dollars paid for tickets.
The hallmark of this credit card is the annualÂ companion fare certificate.Â  With the certificate, you can take a companion on an itinerary of up to four segments within the airlineâs network for a $99 base fare plus certain applicable taxes and fees, which start at approximately $22, but can be more depending on the itinerary. That means, when you add in the cardâs annual fee of $75, you are essentially getting an airline ticket of any value for a companion for about $200.
You can also earn your way to elite status with as few as four cross-country flights.Â  Only the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from our list also offers that companion fare benefit.Â  One area where this card lags some others on our short list: it does not offer priority boarding. (But neither does the JetBlue Plus Card.)

TheÂ JetBlue Plus CardÂ is the enhanced version of the JetBlue Card.Â  The earnings rate for purchasing a JetBlue flight is doubled to 6x points.Â Â All other earning rates remain the same.Â  The card also offers the same inflight savings benefit and no foreign transaction fees.
The standout features of this card are the anniversary bonus of 5,000 points (equivalent to the amount of points you would earn from booking from $625 toÂ  $835 of JetBlue flights online); a $100 annual credit when booking a JetBlue Vacations package; and the ability to earn elite (Mosaic) status from charging $50,000 or more on the card in a year.
At an annual card fee of $99, you are essentially paying up front for the $100 vacation credit and getting the anniversary bonus points for free.

Southwest Airlines only offers credit cards with an annual fee.Â  TheÂ Rapid Rewards Priority CardÂ is the newest card from the airline.Â  This card also has the most expensive annual fee of the airlineâs credit cards â $149.
This airlineâs cards are more or less three trim levels of the same product (standard, luxury, and supreme) as opposed to an airline whose cards are so different that, like Honda and Acura, theyâre marketed as different brands.Â  The card takes on many of the similar features of theÂ other card options:Â  an anniversary points bonus, 2x points per dollar on all Southwest flights or hotel/car rental bookings through the Southwest site, and the ability to use points earned towards the lucrative Companion Pass status.
With Southwest Airlines, a Rapid Rewards member can achieve one form of elite status without actually flyingÂ  â aÂ Companion Pass.Â  The Rapid Rewards Priority Card offers the highest anniversary point bonus at 7,500 points (equivalent to the points youâd earn from booking $1,250 of Wanna Get Away fares on the airline).Â  Also, cardholders receive an annual $75 travel credit, four upgraded bookings to the âAâ boarding group, no foreign transaction fees, tier-qualifying points (up to a certain limit) for every $10,000 spent, inflight savings, and the ability to redeem points for all Southwest products (including partner hotels and car rentals).
Of all these additional benefits, only the $75 travel credit appears unique.Â  The rest are offered by the lower annual fee card for other major airlines with multiple card options.Â  The anniversary bonus is a great benefit to get closer to a free flight each year.Â  Here, you get twice (and more) the bonus of Southwestâs Plus card for essentially the same price.
