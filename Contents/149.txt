HSSC Project Overview 

Concept rendering of Humanities and Social Studies Center – may not represent final design

Purpose of the Project: To bring non-fine arts humanities and social studies departments together in one building to create innovative learning spaces that encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration, active inquiry, student research and “intellectual collisionsâ.



Project Description at a Glance: Includes new construction, plus renovation and expansion of the iconic Alumni Recitation Hall (ARH) and Carnegie Hall.



Key Features: Four pavilions â two renovated and two new â joined by a central atrium. Thirty-nine classrooms and inquiry labs, 145 faculty offices and dedicated research spaces grouped into five interdisciplinary neighborhoods. The atrium features the historic ARH tower and adjoins a cafe, a center for data analysis and a center for global studies.

 


Green Aspects of the Project: A partial green roof, rainwater storage and bioswales will ensure that the HSSC adds no additional rainwater flow into the municipal storm sewer system. The collected rainwater will be utilized for flushing toilets and irrigation. The HSSC will have heat recovery and geothermal heating and cooling, LED lighting with daylight controls and a heat-reflective roof.



Estimated Cost: $112 million
Gross Square Footage: 200,799 (Addition: 147,539, ARH and Carnegie Hall: 53,260)
Architect: EYP Inc., Boston, MA with construction administration assistance from OPN Architects, Des Moines, IA
Construction Manager: McGough Construction, St. Paul, MN
Estimated Completion Date: Early Summer 2020
