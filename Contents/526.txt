    Editorial Note: Forbes adheres to strict editorial integrity standards. The content on this page may contain partner offers and/or affiliate links, and Forbes may receive compensation if you click through a link on this page.  To the best of our knowledge, all content is accurate as of the date posted, though offers contained herein may no longer be available. Business owners know every penny they spend counts. When it comes to making the most of business transactions, using a credit card can be a rewarding strategy.Â 
Business credit cards can offer a range of benefits. These include rewards or cash back, loyalty points, travel protections and expense management. But evaluating each and every card out there to determine which is the best fit for a business can be a time-consuming process—and extra time is something most business owners donât have.Â 
Thatâs why Forbes Advisor created this guide, which does a good part of the work for you. The cards below can all help a business meet its spending needs while offering some extra perks. But each was further chosen as a top pick for specific criteria. The key to finding the best business card for you is identifying which of those factors matter for your business and determining what you value most: Rewards, cash back or help with building credit. Only you can do that part.

            Earn a one-time $500 cash bonus once you spend $4,500 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening        

 
Small business owners are busy, meaning choosing and using a card with complex category rewards can be time consuming. The Capital One Spark Cash for Business card is a great fit for small businesses looking for a simple yet generous cash back rewards program and a low APR.
Rewards: Earn unlimited 2% cash back that can be redeemed any time and with no minimums. For a company spending $10,000 per month, that can equal $2,900 cash back in the first year, including the bonus offer (see below).
Annual Fee: $0 for the first year, $95 per year after.
Bonus Offer: $500 cash back bonus after spending $4,500 on purchases within the first three months of opening the account.Â 
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: Other benefits of this card include free employee cards, meaning small business owners can earn more cash back faster. Cash back rewards can be redeemed at any time and have no expiration date.
A downside, however, is this card isnât for a businesses or owner with less than stellar credit. With its strict requirement for âexcellentâ credit,â the Capital One Spark Cash for Business will only work for businesses and owners with first rate credit histories.Â

The Wells Fargo Business Secured credit card is an ideal credit card for new businesses, and for good reason. This card not only serves companies and owners still working to establish credit, but it goes a lot further than a traditional credit card and offers generous perks.Â 
How it works: This credit card is secured, meaning the card will have a credit line based upon the amount deposited, which can range from $500 to $25,000 on this card.Â 
Rewards: Earn 1.5% cash back for every $1 spent on purchases, with no limit or earn one point on every $1 spent
Annual Fee: $25 per cardÂ 
Bonus Offer: Receive a one-time bonus of 1,000 bonus points when $1,000 or more is spent in any monthly billing period.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: A secured credit card is a great way to build a credit history, but can be a challenge for companies low on start-up cash. Wells Fargoâs lowest requirement for collateral is a modest $500, and the company will periodically evaluate accounts to determine eligibility for an unsecured line.
Additionally, this card gives customers the option to choose between cash back or rewards. Wells Fargo rewards can be redeemed for a wide range of categories, including airline tickets, merchandise, TSA Preâ and more. Rewards points are currently valued at one and a half cents per point, but can fluctuate based upon category redemption.Â 
Additional perks of the Wells Fargo Business Secured card include a zero liability program, expense management tools, overdraft protection and automatic bill pay.

            Unlimited dollar-for-dollar match of all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year, automatically. There's no signing up. And no limit to how much we'll match. So you could turn $350 cashback into $700 with Cashback Match        

 
If a card is offering cash back, a sky-high annual fee can significantly offset earnings. Choosing a cashback card with no annual fee is a great way to maintain the full value of the credit cardâs offer.
The Discover it card doesnât have a fixed dollar or bonus points sign-up bonus, but it has a distinct sign-up bonus system that makes up for it. At the end of the first year, all the cash back the business owner has earned (at a 1.5% rate) is matched on a one for one basis. Thereâs no dollar limit on the spending that is eligible for either the 1.5% back or the match. For a card spend of $50,000 per year, the potential cash back reaches $1,500 (1.5% unlimited cash back + the first year cashback match).
DiscoverâsÂ  rival no-fee cash back card, the Chase Ink Business Unlimited, offers the same unlimited 1.5% cash back, with a sign-up $500 bonus, and no match at the end of the year. Assuming $50,000 is charged in the first year, the Discover it card will provide $250 more in cash back at the end of one year.Â  For a business that will spend a lot less in the first year, however, the Chase Ink Business Unlimited card might be the better deal.
Rewards: Unlimited 1.5% cash back on every dollar for every purchase. Cash back is matched at the end of the first year with no limit.Â 
Annual Fee: None
Bonus Offer: None
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The Discover it card comes with the ability to easily download transactions to Quickbooks, Quicken or Excel, making expense management easier. There are also no overlimit fees, no late fees on the first late payment and no foreign transaction fees. Discover also claims that paying late on this card wonât raise the cardâs APR.
The highest APR on the Discover it card is slightly higher than other no-fee business cards, so cardholders with less-than-great credit will end up paying more in interest than with other cards.

            Earn 80,000 bonus points after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.        

 
The Chase Ink Business Preferred card offers one of the highest points per cent value and an impressive bonus offer, making it a top pick for business travel.Â 
Rewards: Earn three points per $1 on the first $150,000 spent on travel, shipping, internet, cable and phone services, and advertising purchases on social media and search engines. A business taking full advantage of this rewards offer would earn 450,000 points ($150,000 x 3) on these categories alone.
The value of these points depends on how they are redeemed. If redeemed for cash or a statement credit, the rewards would have a value of $4,500. Redeem the points for travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards, and cardholders receive a 25% bonus, bringing the value up to $5,625. Finally, cardholders can transfer points to partner airlines and hotel brands. With some airline miles worth as much as two cents, the value of these rewards could reach $9,000 per year.
Annual Fee: $95
Bonus Offer: Earn an additional 80,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months after opening an account.Â  According to Chaseâs website, thatâs worth $1,000 toward travel when used to book through the Chase ultimate rewards platform. One major advantage to Chase points is that they often increase in value when transferred to partner programs â making this bonus offer worth as much as $1,600.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The Chase Ink Business Preferred card also comes with significant travel protection, such as trip cancellation insurance up to $5,000 per trip, cell phone protection up to $600 per claim and auto rental collision insurance. This cardâs annual fee is much lower than for other competitor travel cards. Moreover, points can be used toward travel with 12 airlines and three hotel programs, giving cardholders flexibility and choice when it comes to redeeming travel points.
One drawback of the Chase Ink Business Preferred card is that the bonus offer requires spending $5,000 within the first three months, which is higher than required for the bonuses on other travel rewards cards. Some businesses, however, might find it relatively easy to hit this threshold.Â

For businesses looking for the best rewards program to join, American Express Business Gold card is an excellent option. American Express is among the highest in membership point valuation, with one point equaling as much as two cents depending on how it’s redeemed. The Gold business card offers generous point redemption towards gift cards, prepaid hotels, flights, Amazon shopping and more.
Rewards: 4X points on two select categories where you spend most each month (automatically determined by AMEX), and get 25% of the points you use to book flights back into your rewards account.
Annual Fee: $295
Bonus Offer: Earn up to $500 back in the form of statement credits by purchasing qualifying services with FedEx using your American ExpressÂ® Business Gold Card within the first 3 months of Card membership.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The American Express Business Gold also offers up to one year free of G Suite Basic for three users and ZipRecruiter Standard in the first 12 months of membership; according to the card website, thatâs a combined value of up to $3,200 when taking advantage of both offers.
Additionally, American Express has one of the most robust benefits programs out there. Cardholders have the ability to pay balances over time with interest, and there are no pre-set spending limits on the Business Gold card. Business owners can also transfer card transaction data directly into QuickBooks for easier expense tracking.
American Express also grants users travel and transportation protections, such as baggage insurance, emergency assistance, no foreign transaction fees and statement credits for booking at partner hotels.
The annual fee on the Business Gold card can seem daunting at first. A business that makes this its primary card, however, can quickly earn back the $295 fee in the form of membership rewards.Â Â

            Get a one-time $1,000 cash back bonus or 100,000 bonus points when you enroll in the Business Elite Card Rewards Program and spend $15,000 in the first three months of account open date        

 
The Wells Fargo Business Elite Card card is great for larger businesses ($1 million in sales and up) looking to give employees cards. It also offers a healthy $1,000 cash sign-up bonus.Â 
Rewards: Earn 1.5% cash back on every $1 spent or one point on every $1 spent
Annual Fee: None, but there is an optional $75 membership rewards program (with the fee waived for the first 12 months)
Bonus Offer: Get a one-time $1,000 cash back bonus when you spend $15,000 in the first three months or enroll in the rewards program and spend $15,000 to receive 100,000 bonus points when you spend $15,000 in the first three months.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: This card is only for businesses with annual sales over $1 million. On the plus side, it has no foreign transaction fees and provides free cards for up to 200 employees, with spending controls, online reporting tools and more.Â 
Cardholders should be careful when considering enrolling in the rewards program. Typically, one rewards point equal one cent, making the 100,000 bonus points worth $1,000. After the first year, the $75 fee would make the rewards program less valuable than the cashback option.

The CitiBusiness/AAdvantage Platinum Select World Mastercard comes with alluring benefits like reduced mileage awards and preferred boarding. Plus, American Airlinesâ miles valuation system is generous for both domestic and international travel. For example, trips to Asia can cost as little as 70,000 miles roundtrip.

While this card does come with the ability to receive a companion certificate, cardholders have to spend $30,000 or more in a year in order to be eligible. Some competitor cards offer these at no cost, but they have much higher annual fees.

            Credit Score ranges are based on FICOÂ® credit scoring. This is just one scoring method and a credit card issuer may use another method when considering your application. These are provided as guidelines only and approval is not guaranteed.

The Brex Visa Commercial credit card is the best option for startup owners who need the flexibility of high credit limits and instant approval without putting their own credit on the line.Â  Instead, Brex determines credit lines based upon how much funding and equity a company has, as well as its spending patterns. Since Brex is geared towards startups, it offers the most generous points, as well as special deals, on expenses startups are likely to incur.Â 
Rewards: 7x points on rideshare, 4x points on Brex travel, 3X points on spending at restaurants, 2X points on recurring software and 1X point on all other purchases. Rewards have no limit and never expire.
Annual Fee: None
Bonus Offer: Brex has some of the most impressive bonus offers with 15 partners, including Experian, HubSpot, Amazon Web Services, Google Ads, WeWork and more. These services include statement credits or discounts to subscriptions.
Other Benefits or Drawbacks: The Brex card comes with five additional cards for free, but any additional users, beyond those five, cost $5 per month â more than competitor cards charge. Brexâs rewards system, however, is generous enough to earn those user fees back.Â 






How to pick a business credit card
With the many different types of credit cards available, picking one for a business can be a lengthy process. Prospective cardholders have multiple factors to take into consideration before landing on a best-pick, including:

How much will the card cost per year? Annual fees often cover membership benefits offered by cards. Prospective cardholders should calculate how much theyâll need to spend in order to accumulate enough rewards or cash back to offset the fee.

How much will additional cards cost? Adding additional employee cards to an account can be a smart way to generate more rewards, but confirm how much each additional card will cost per year.

How much are membership or rewards points worth? Some cards have high points per dollar offers, but when it comes to redeeming the points, they fall flat. Be diligent in evaluating each point value; if itâs less than one cent per point, itâs a weak offer.

What are other fees associated with the card, aside from the annual fee? Pay close attention to the cardâs terms and conditions to determine if there are fees associated with foreign transactions, late payments, overlimits and more.

What is the APR? If your business needs to carry a balance, looking for a card with low interest rates, or interest-free promotional periods, can save money. Always remember that APRs are determined based on your creditworthiness, so the lowest interest rate presented in the terms and conditions might not be what youâre granted upon approval.

Do I need a personal guarantee? Establishing business credit can be difficult, and some cards will require a personal guarantee. This means an individual, usually the one applying for the card on behalf of the company, will be held liable for any balances left unpaid on the card. For individuals who donât want to be tied to their business account, there are cards available that donât require a personal guarantee, such as the Brex Visa Commercial Credit Card.





Other business credit cards to consider
Although these are Forbesâ top picks, there are numerous cards not listed that have attractive features. For example, the American Express Plum card offers a 1.5% early pay discount, but also allows cardholders to pay up to 60 days late without interest. For businesses with big spending, this card can be a flexible payment option.Â 
There are numerous loyalty-rewards business credit cards available through major companies including Delta, Marriott, JetBlue and American Airlines. For businesses that predominantly use one hotel chain or airline, these rewards cards can maximize earnings and discounts on purchases throughout the year.Â 
Additionally, prospective cardholders looking for intriguing business credit card offers should check with their local credit unions. Since these institutions are member-owned non-profits, they arenât subject to the same profit pressures or corporate income taxes as large banks and are able to offer lower interest rates as a result. Credit unions can be a great place for brand new businesses to establish their credit.
