In Iowa, 2 Colleges Separated by 150 Miles and $1.37-Billion

At Clarke, every student matters, particularly to the bottom line
Sitting atop a bluff along the Mississippi River here, Clarke College is a place where students call their professors by first names, where people rarely fail to greet each other in the hallways, and where, once a semester, faculty and staff members flip more than 20 pounds of pancakes to serve students a late-night snack.
The intimate interaction among faculty members, administrators, and students is central to the character of Clarke, a Roman Catholic liberal-arts institution with a full-time enrollment of 1,068. The college's mission statement says that it strives to be a "caring, learning community," following in the tradition of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who founded Clarke in 1843. And the personal attention is an advantage that many similar, small liberal-arts colleges across the nation tout as a quality that sets them apart from larger public and private institutions in the American higher-education landscape.
But paying close attention to each individual, and to recruiting and retaining them, isn't just a philosophical nicety for colleges like Clarke. It's a financial necessity.At Clarke, more than three-fifths of the $18-million operating budget comes from tuition and fees, and another fifth comes from auxiliary services such as residence halls and food service. With an endowment of only $17-million, Clarke doesn't have much of a financial cushion to help pay the bills when it misses enrollment targets, even by handfuls of students.Clarke "defines almost every private college that has less than 1,500 enrollment and less than a $50-million endowment," says Thomas C. Longin, an independent consultant for colleges on strategic planning. He estimates that about 800 institutions, roughly half of the nation's four-year private colleges, face budget scenarios similar to Clarke's.He argues that those institutions are not necessarily on the brink of demise but that their futures are bleak. It is extraordinarily difficult, he and other college-planning experts say, for the Clarke Colleges of the nation to transcend a pattern of budget planning that focuses on scraping by from year to year."They've got a real cash-flow problem," says Mr. Longin. "And it is really hard to take strategic initiatives when they are not able to carve out any money."Fighting to GrowOver the years, Clarke has added academic programs and facilities to foster growth and to better serve its market, which is heavily focused on students who live in the rural region that surrounds this river city. To its undergraduate programs, Clarke has added master's programs in business administration, education, nursing, and physical therapy. This year it began its first doctoral program, also in physical therapy,

And the college is searching for ways to attract money from new sources, such as foundations, and to build up its endowment. Clarke officials acknowledge that they were slow to focus on developing an endowment because leaders relied for many years on the value of contributed services of the nuns who work at the college. As the number of nuns working at the college has shrunk, so has the value of their salaries to the bottom line. Now, that value accounts for only 2 percent of revenues.Clarke has survived a fire, which destroyed about a third of its buildings in 1984. The college used the opportunity to build a modern, signature campus structure that serves as a central gathering place. Its 56-foot-tall glass atrium — where the library, chapel, art gallery, and administrative offices meet — encloses a courtyard that has wireless Internet access and a softly bubbling fountain.Over the past 12 years, the college has added other facilities to improve student life, including a dormitory with apartment-style living, which provides students with individual rooms in suites that include kitchens, as well as a new student-activities center and a sports complex with a bigger gym and indoor track, racquetball courts, and dirt-floored batting cages.But for all the upgrades Clarke has made, tight budgets have still limited the college's ability to offer some of the amenities that help attract students to a campus. Most incoming students move into two dormitories that were built in the 1960s and that lack such modern features as air-conditioning. The college's fitness center is small and situated over half of an old basketball court, and some of its athletics teams, like baseball, must use public parks and other off-campus facilities as their home fields.Annual AnxietySister Catherine Dunn, Clarke's president, says college officials pride themselves on doing the best they can with facilities, keeping them clean and making improvements when possible. And she says she places her priority on protecting academic programs and has been largely able to avoid laying off faculty members (though she has left some positions open) during her 22-year tenure, no matter how tight the budgets.This spring, once again, Sister Catherine is planning for another year of very tight budgets. Financial-aid offers have just gone out to prospective students, and she is anxiously waiting to learn how many deposits for next fall's class will come in."This is always a nervous time for me," says Sister Catherine, who is retiring at the end of June.So far this year, the numbers are running ahead of last year, when Clarke officials missed their enrollment goal by about 20 students. The result: about $500,000 less revenue.While wealthy colleges could make up such a shortfall by using reserves or taking more from their endowment, Clarke had little choice but to tighten the purse strings across the campus. Spending on travel, subscriptions, and other expenses has been pared, and departments' budgets for supplies and other items are receiving more scrutiny. Faculty-salary increases that would have otherwise been given out this spring are being delayed until final enrollments are known in the fall.

The financial pressures on Clarke, and institutions like it, to enroll as many students as possible often lead them to make admissions offers more attractive by providing generous amounts of institutional aid. That is one area in which Clarke's interim vice president for business affairs is encouraging the college to cut back."People get carried away with tuition discounting," says Edward Whalen, who took over the position in January. "If you're not careful, you end up giving away more money than it costs you to educate per student."On average, Clarke provides its students institutional aid worth about 38 percent of the price of tuition. Incoming freshmen receive even more, an average of about 47 percent, and some students receive as much as 60 percent. On average, private four-year colleges of a size similar to Clarke discount their undergraduate students' tuition by 35.5 percent and their freshman students' tuition by 39.9 percent, according to a study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.Mr. Whalen has urged Clarke to be more selective about tuition discounting and to focus on using the practice to lure truly exceptional students.Admissions officials are also scaling back their generosity in other ways. For example, Clarke had routinely tried to find institutional funds for Iowa applicants who had missed a deadline for need-based grants, worth up to $4,000, that the state provides its residents at in-state private institutions. Clarke is stopping that practice and doing more to encourage students to meet the state deadline.Seeking a NicheClarke officials are also seeking new ways to draw students and raise money. Administrators and faculty members are hoping to do both through an undergraduate program in bioinformatics Clarke is establishing this year.Clarke's admissions officers are reporting that at many college fairs, Clarke is the only institution that offers the major, a discipline that combines the study of computer science, biology, and chemistry to analyze large databases, such as those on genomes. And Melba Rodriguez, Clarke's vice president for institutional advancement, says the program is already attracting attention from at least one foundation that has not looked at Clarke before.Last month she learned that the W.M. Keck Foundation, a Los Angeles-based fund that provides grants for science, engineering, and medical research, wanted to visit Clarke, a sign that the group was seriously considering the college's application for a $766,600 grant. Clarke applied for the money to finance a project through its bioinformatics program that would allow students to help develop advanced Web-based tools to analyze data on HIV."To get a foundation's attention is very exciting," Ms. Rodriguez says. Winning a grant from a nationally known foundation, she adds, could help a college like Clarke gain a higher profile and possibly make it easier to attract money from other private and governmental sources in the future.

But even as Clarke is adding programs, it is also seeking funds to make basic improvements in some of its core disciplines that limited budgets have not allowed. The college is undertaking a campaign to raise $5-million to update its 40-year-old science laboratories, which need better ventilation and plumbing so more students can work in them.Clarke's chemistry professors and students say they also need better equipment to conduct more-accurate experiments. Their wish list includes a cold-room facility, to help them better control temperatures than they can with Styrofoam buckets of ice that they now use, and a mass spectrometer, an instrument that identifies separate components of materials.Ellen Reisch, a senior from Dubuque who is majoring in chemistry, is trying to examine the active ingredients in herbal medications, a task that she says is very difficult without a spectrometer to help her isolate those ingredients from other matter. "There are so many other things in there that I don't know what they are," she says. And without better instruments, "I don't even know where to begin to identify them."Ideas for ReformWhen a college is stretched as thin as Clarke is, it must continually evaluate what programs are essential to support. If an undergraduate major does not have at least 20 students, it is put on a watch list and given three years to grow. If it does not, the major is reshaped or phased out, as is now happening with Clarke's sociology program.Clarke's incoming president, Sister Joanne Burrows, says she plans to seek reforms that will refine the college's academic mission, to focus it more sharply on market needs. Sister Joanne, who is chief academic officer at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, says she may consider adding more graduate programs and incorporating distance education into some offerings. She says she does not yet know Clarke well enough to offer a specific plan for broader changes at the institution."We may need to stop being all things to all people," she says, "and find real opportunities to serve the market."Mr. Longin, the independent consultant, agrees that small private colleges need to reinvent themselves in bold ways if they want to have even a chance at escaping their cycles of minimal budgets.He suggests that such colleges consider thematic changes to serve emerging markets and needs in academe. For example, an institution might try to improve how American students understand global issues by adapting the college's entire curriculum to include more international perspectives and analysis.Without changes that can bring more distinction to the hundreds of small liberal-arts colleges that survive on the margins, Mr. Longin says, he worries that academic quality will suffer at many of these institutions and that they will not be serving society as effectively or efficiently as they could."I do see a value to these places," he says, "but I don't see a lot of will among many of them to really get significantly better."But other higher-education experts emphasize that society will need to continue to rely on many of these liberal-arts colleges. Larry Goldstein, president of Campus Strategies, a company that consults on business affairs for colleges, praises liberal-arts institutions for their role in serving a wide spectrum of students, including those who do not learn well in large environments and those who may be shut out of increasingly competitive public institutions. The individualized attention at these colleges, he says, can be particularly helpful to low-income students and those whose parents never attended college."I won't call these colleges a safety net, but in fact, for many people they do end up being a safety net," Mr. Goldstein says.Offering SupportAt Clarke, almost one-third of the undergraduates are eligible for federal Pell Grants, and more than one-third are among the first in their families to attend college.Nick Marlette, a sophomore from Waverly, Iowa, who is majoring in social work at Clarke, plans to be the first in his family to earn a four-year degree. His mother is a secretary, and his father works as a mechanic.Clarke appealed to him, he says, because it offered the chance to play soccer and because the college environment provided him the academic and personal support he sought. "The people are great," he says, raving about many one-on-one interactions with his professors and the constant stream of friendly hellos he gets when he crosses campus. "Everyone is real close."The intimacy of Clarke has helped many of its students find their place. Now Clarke must develop a niche for itself, if it, too, is to thrive.
