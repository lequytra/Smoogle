Editor-in-Chief
Jackson Schulte
Jackson Schulte is co-editor-in-chief for The S&B. He grew up in a few different towns in Iowa, including Grinnell, and is grateful to be in his final year of living in a town where he can see both his college classmates and his high school teachers at McNally’s. He wishes he liked birdwatching, but he knows nothing about it. You can reach him at schultej@grinnell.edu.

Arts Editor
Abraham Teuber
Abraham Teuber is the Arts Editor for the S&B. He is a second-year from St. Paul, Minnesota and plans on majoring in English. On campus, Abraham sings in The Grinnell Singers and Con Brio and co-hosts âWhatâs the Score?â on KDIC. He loves Twitter, A24 films, and Amy Adams, but he hates Greg Heffley. Abraham peaked in 8th grade as the runner-up in his regional spelling bee. The word he was eliminated on was âchaldronâ. What a moron. You can reach him at teuberab@grinnell.edu.

Community Editor
Ingrid Meulemans
Ingrid Meulemans is the Community Editor for The S&B. She technically grew up in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin but feels deeply connected to the Ingalls family homestead in Walnut Grove, Minnesota as detailed in the critically acclaimed book On the Banks of Plum Creek by Laura Ingalls Wilder. As a child, Ingrid unapologetically loved horses. However, she does not let this dictate her life. Instead, Ingrid chooses to define herself by her crippling peanut allergy and borderline unhealthy Sylvia Plath obsession. Ingrid will probably major in English due to the fact that an independent study of just the last 15 minutes of the Keira Knightley version of Pride &Â  Prejudice was deemed ânot feasibleâ. She can be reached at meuleman@grinnell.edu.
Opinions Editor
Andy Pavey
Andy is the Opinions Editor for The S&B. He is a second-year from LeClaire, Iowa. Best known for his âresting disappointed face,â Andy is an esteemed member of the Lunch Bunch. When heâs sad, he enjoys listening to music that makes him even sadder. You can reach him at paveyand@grinnell.edu.

Copy Editor
Montserrat CastroÂ 
Mon is a third-year from QuerÃ©taro, MÃ©xico. She is a French and Gender, Women’s and Sexuality Studies double major (but in a happier, better world, an English major). When she’s not copy editing, she is eating Maruchan ramen, complaining about the United States, exposing sexists, or telling people how much she likes their dyed hair. She still doesn’t know when to use “on” or “in” in a sentence, but does not let that affect her work. She can be reached atÂ castromo@grinnell.edu.
Copy Editor
Wini Austin
She can be reached atÂ austinwi@grinnell.edu.
