Itâs something more than a place, much bigger than an idea. Grinnell is a way of being and seeing. An unwavering commitment to your journey of discovery, both in everything you want to do and everything you want to become.


Why Grinnell












Application Process

        
                  It begins by telling us about you.
      
  
    

Grinnell is highly selective, and no single factor guarantees admission. However, our students come from all different backgrounds. So tell us your story. We'll tell you what documents you'll need, connect you to resources, and help you with any questions along the way.

I love that I go to a college where the only thing people care about is the quality of the character and the things that I bring to the table, not what I'm wearing, or how I sound, or how I look. At Grinnell, I feel free to be who I am.

Grinnell was really the first place where I actually had the chance, or the self-awareness, to pursue somethingÂ thatÂ was a little bit out of my comfort zone.
