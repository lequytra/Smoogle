The Fine Print
You may also send letters to the editor via e-mail to newspapr@grinnell.edu. The authorâs name must be included, but letters can be published anonymously in certain occasions upon request. Letters become the property of TheÂ S&BÂ and will be printed at the discretion of the editor. TheÂ S&BÂ reserves the right to edit any and all submissions. The deadline for publication in each Friday’s paper is the previous Wednesday at noon. Please do not include footnotes in the letters to the editor. The opinions expressed in letters to the editor, opinion columns and advertising do not necessarily reflect the opinions of TheÂ S&B, SPARC or Grinnell College.
