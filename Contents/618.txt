The campus of Harvard Business School2016 Brooks KraftBy Kurt Badenhausen and Christina SettimiThis is Forbesâ 11th biennial ranking of the best business schools around the globe. It is based on one question: Is a full-time M.B.A. worth it? It is not an easy answer when the costs in terms of tuition, fees and forgone compensation can top $350,000 at the top schools.Most M.B.A.s apply to school for a career change and/or greater financial rewards. The Forbes ranking is based solely on the median returns on investment achieved by the graduates from the class of 2014. Returns for individuals vary wildly, and the results for graduates from business schools outside the top tier are often weak.We looked at more than 100 schools and surveyed 17,500 alumni regarding their pre- and post-M.B.A. compensation, career choice and location. We received replies from 25% of those graduates. We excluded schools from the rankings when we did not hear back from at least 15% of their alumni. We also did not include schools for which alumni had a negative ROI after five years.We compared alumni earnings in their first five years out of business school with their opportunity cost (two years of forgone compensation, tuition and required fees). We measure total compensation, including salary, bonuses and exercised stock options. We assume that compensation would have risen half as fast as their post-M.B.A. salary increases had these alumni not attended business school.We rank the schools solely on their âfive-year M.B.A. gain.â It represents the net cumulative amount the typical alumni would have earned after five years by getting their M.B.A. versus staying in their pre-M.B.A. career. Chicago Booth ranks on top for the first time ever in the Forbes rankings with a five-year gain of $94,400.London Business School rated as the best two-year international program for the seventh straight time with a gain of $119,100. IMD is the leading one-year program at $168,900. It has been on top four of the past five Forbes rankings. One-year programs have an inherent advantage under this methodology thanks to the smaller forgone costs of relinquishing only one-year of salary.The five-year M.B.A. gains, along with the pre-M.B.A. and 2018 salaries, use a five-year average for the exchange rates. We adjusted the salaries used to determine the median five-year M.B.A. gains for the cost of living using an index from Expatistan. A $100,000 salary provides more bang for the buck in Jakarta than in New York City or the San Francisco Bay Area. We discounted the earnings gains to account for the time value of money. The rate of 4.1% is the discount rate most recently used by large companies in their pension funds. Low rates help prop up the five-year gains.We also discounted tuition to account for students who pay in-state rates and for scholarships and the non-repayable financial aid that schools provide. We did not deduct taxes from the earnings gains or account for the debt repayments from student loans. Debt is an increasing burden for graduates with a median value of $80,000 for those alumni who replied to us and finished owing money, compared to $75,000 two years ago.Additional reporting: Olivia AbramsMore reading:Americaâs Best Business Schools: Chicago Booth Ranks On TopIMD And London Business School Top Ranking Of The Best International M.B.A ProgramsFeeder Colleges And Companies To Stanford GSB: Deep Dive Analysis Of The M.B.A. Class Of 2020
