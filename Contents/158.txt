Campus Landscaping, Entry, and Wayfinding Project Overview 

Concept rendering of South Campus – may not represent final design

Purpose of the Project: To create a master landscaping plan that creates a campus environment that is interesting, engaging, and complementary to Grinnellâs indoor learning spaces; that better defines entry points to the campus; and that implements a helpful campus wayfinding system.
Project Description at a Glance: Phase I includes implementation of select elements of the master plan focusing largely on the academic quad, the spaces adjacent to the HSSC and AFA, as well as routing from the north end of campus to the academic quad. This part of the project will include attractive new entry points for the campus and improved wayfinding with newly designed signage across campus.
Key Features: A redesigned academic quadrangle, including relocation of the commencement stage; plazas, including new gathering spaces between the HSSC and Noyce Science Center; tree-lined pedestrian pathways; new campus entry points at Park Street and Sixth Avenue and at Park Street and Eighth Avenue; and landscaping to complement the HSSC and AFA.
Green Aspects of the Project: Using bioswales (depressions that collect storm water and send it back into the aquifer instead of into storm sewers), prairie-type native plantings that are sustainable in our climate. The master plan for the entire campus will encompass management of storm water runoff.
Estimated Cost Phase 1: $14 million
Architect: Ayers Saint Gross (ASG), Baltimore, MD (primary) in partnership with Confluence landscape architects, Des Moines, IA
Construction Manager: McGough Construction, St. Paul, MN
Completion Date: The initial elements of the landscape implementation will be completed over a two-year period with work taking place from May to October in 2018 and 2019. Work is expected to be finished by November 2019, including new entrances to campus and wayfinding signage. The balance of the Landscape Master Plan will be implemented in future phases.
